In this episode of Vox Almanac, Phil Edwards explores the history and controversy behind the style.Known as tonsure, the typical monk hairstyle has many variations throughout religions. The particular hairstyle worn by Christian monks has its own variations and controversies as well.  Three different types of tonsure were popular: a coronal tonsure, a Pauline tonsure, and a third Celtic tonsure that came to represent the differences between the Roman Catholic and Celtic Catholic church.The winding path of this tonsure is a new way to look at the division within the religion and the unpredictable ways something like hair can represent faith.Support our work and get a peek behind the scenes at Vox by joining the Vox Video Lab, our members community on YouTube.

Haunted by an unexplainable and unresolved trauma from her past and compounded by a string of eerie coincidences, Adelaide feels her paranoia elevate to high-alert as she grows increasingly certain that something bad is going to befall her family.After spending a tense beach day with their friends, the Tylers (Emmy winner Elisabeth Moss, Tim Heidecker, Cali Sheldon, Noelle Sheldon), Adelaide and her family return to their vacation home. When darkness falls, the Wilsons discover the silhouette of four figures holding hands as they stand in the driveway. Us pits an endearing American family against a terrifying and uncanny opponent: doppelg√§ngers of themselves. Writer and director Peele produces for his Monkeypaw Productions alongside Sean McKittrick, Jason Blum, and Monkeypaw‚Äôs Ian Cooper. Us will be released by Universal Pictures on Friday, March 15, 2019."

Comment, like, share this story.You all know who Lilly Singh is, right? How could you not? She's an actress, a comedian, a huge YouTube star, and a social media celebrity of the highest degree! She also has a huge heart and believes in empowering young woman (and everybody for that matter) to be their best most powerful selves. Lilly Singh is amazing, and we're sure she always has been BUT before she was famous she was just a kid doing all those things kids do - hanging out with friends and family (she has lots of cousins), playing video games, and finding ways not to be bored, like watching horror movies and telling each other scary stories, and playing with each others imaginations.When she was younger all of her cousins would go to her house to hang out with her and her sister. The parents would all head off to work and the kids would all look after each other - immigranthustle. One day, just after their parents left, they were all piled onto the couch playing video games when the phone rang. Her older cousin answered it, said hello a few times, but nobody was there. Weird, but maybe just a wrong number, or at worst a crank call.Lilly and her cousins got back to their video game, and had played for a little while when the phone rang again. This time another cousin answered and the same thing happened, nobody was on the other end, or at least they weren't saying anything. It was a little scary, what kind of evil demon of a person would do that to a bunch of kids?At that point Lilly and her cousins could have come up with some good rational reasons for the phone calls - like a wrong number, a bad connection, a telemarketer, etc. BUT that's not what a bunch of kids home alone do, so instead they came up with a whole story about how some evil demon or person was trying to get to them and do bad things!They decided they needed a master plan, a way to make sure their story didn't turn out to be a scary horror story. Now, keep in mind, this was right around Christmas and they had just finished doing a Home Alone marathon.They began by documenting all of the calls that came in and capturing  every detail. This would help them come up with their plan for scaring away the evil demon, or whatever - the evil telemarketer. On day three they received more calls than usual and they felt it was definitely a sign. They brainstormed their plan.Was it a robber? A spirit? A demon? The possibilities were endless. Their planning was interrupted when one of their cousins stopped them as said hey, didn't you guys hear that? Now, Lilly hadn't heard anything, but what was the fun of that, and, if there was some demonic Christmas Home Alone presence there with them, she didn't want to be the first to go just because she didn't believe it was real. She wasn't going to be THAT kid in the horror movie. Or one of those ghost stories. It was time to take action. They all gathered up all the utensils from the kitchen drawers and then executed their plan : lock themselves in their parents bedroom and wait it out. But before they locked themselves  in the room they strategically placed three little porcelain pigs in the hallway that could warn them if something trampled that way.Hours went by with them locked in the bedroom, pacing, sweating, stressing and terrified. But, eventually their need for Oreos overcame them so they ventured into the kitchen and felt so relieved, and silly for acting so scared and ridiculous. UNTIL they noticed that one of the little pigs had been knocked over.They freaked out, and around the house, and then finally decided it was time to take a stand - it was either them, or the demon! They searched the entire house with their forks and butter knives ready. But of course, they found nothing.A couple of hours later her parents returned home and all their cousins left. End of story, right? Well, they never felt anymore evil presences, and the phone stopped ringing, but, you never know.

Even at 5:30 am when we arrived it was vibrant and busy, and action packed. It was a good start to the day, because especially when I eat seafood, I love to visit the fish market and get a sense of the seafood available before eating it. We also stopped at the fisherman canteen for a quick local Pakistani Karachi breakfast of paratha and chai.We drove out to the beach house, about an hour from the center of Karachi, along the Arabian sea. Already, the seafood feast was underway. There‚Äôs was both a full grill section of seafood, and a full curry section.Everything was delicious, but the highlight were the crab lollipops, mostly crab claws and arms, which were tossed in a beautiful curry sauce. It was spectacular.And this seafood meal was the perfect way to end an amazing trip to Pakistan!-----End of Pakistan video series:For 16 Days the People of Pakistan greeted us with respect and hospitality, allowed me to film, invited us into their homes, and many, even refused to let us to pay for food we ate... and the list goes on. Thank you to the People of Pakistani for your amazing hospitality and welcome.

The Doom Patrol's members each suffered horrible accidents that gave them superhuman abilities ‚Äî but also left them scarred and disfigured. Traumatized and downtrodden, the team found purpose through The Chief, who brought them together to investigate the weirdest phenomena in existence ‚Äî and to protect Earth from what they find.

Picking up after the events of TITANS, DOOM PATROL will find these reluctant heroes in a place they never expected to be, called to action by none other than Cyborg, who comes to them with a mission hard to refuse, but with a warning that is hard to ignore: their lives will never, ever be the same.Based on DC characters originally written and drawn by Arnold Drake, Bob Haney and Bruno Premiani#DCUDOOMPATROL premieres February 15.

Go to https://NordVPN.com/MarkRober and use code MARKROBER to get 75% off a 3 year plan and an extra month for free.My buddy Sean posted a video with more details of the build: https://youtu.be/IpMxOmUcfOINote about 2 missing the reactions in the video- I was presented with information that caused me to doubt the veracity of 2 of the 5 reactions in the video.  These were reactions that were captured during a two week period while the device was at house 2 hours away from where I live.  I put a feeler out for people willing to put a package on their porch and this person (who is a friend of a friend) volunteered to help.  To compensate them for their time and willingness to risk putting a package on their porch I offered financial compensation for any successful recoveries of the package.  It appears (and I've since confirmed) in these two cases, the ‚Äúthieves were actually acquaintances of the person helping me.  From the footage I received from the phones which intentionally only record at specific times, this wasn‚Äôt clear to me. I have since removed those reactions from the original video (originally 6:26-7:59).  I‚Äôm really sorry about this.  Ultimately, I am responsible for the content that goes on my channel and I should have done more here.  I can vouch for that the reactions were genuine when the package was taken from my house.  Having said that,  I know my credibly is sort of shot but I encourage you to look at the types of videos I‚Äôve been making for the past 7 years.  This is my first ever video with some kind of ‚Äúprank and like I mentioned in the video it‚Äôs pretty removed from my comfort zone and I should have done more.  I‚Äôm especially gutted because so much thought, time, money and effort went into building the device and I hope this doesn‚Äôt just taint the entire effort as ‚Äúfake.  It genuinely works (like all the other things I‚Äôve built on my channel) and we‚Äôve made all the code and build info public.  Again, I‚Äôm sorry for putting something up on my channel that was misleading.  That is totally on me and I will take all necessary steps to make sure it won‚Äôt happen again.High Speed camera courtesy of https://www.aimed-research.com/.

She‚Äôll tell it to you straight: she‚Äôs the opposite of good-looking. That is, she‚Äôs simply ugly. It‚Äôs not that she‚Äôs an attention-seeker or anything who wants to hear things like ‚ÄúOh no, Dory, you‚Äôre so pretty, don‚Äôt say that!‚Äù In her opinion, no one in their right mind would call her pretty.Your looks are a genetic lottery, as they say. And in Doris‚Äô case, she didn‚Äôt get a single correct number called out. Both her parents look fine, and no one knows whom she takes after. She‚Äôs also totally healthy, has no impairments or deformations, and it‚Äôs only her face that startles people. Her older brother also looks fine, just like her parents.Doris would be happy to tell you that she‚Äôs now accustomed to seeing her reflection, but in actual fact, even now she wants to call the exorcist every time she sees herself in the mirror. However, it feels so nice that she can be humorous about it now instead of telling a dramatic story full of suffering. But she hasn‚Äôt always had this relaxed attitude towards herself. As you can imagine, over the years she‚Äôs compiled a truly golden compilation of ‚Äúmotivational‚Äù phrases and insults that an ugly person might receive throughout their life. When she was little, it was a bit easier to live with her looks. Toddlers normally don‚Äôt notice such things. But their parents do. She still remembers some of the comments that were expressed to her parents when they were in a play park: ‚ÄúOh, it‚Äôs much more important for a girl to be nice and pleasant than to have good looks, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù And she remembers seeing her mom‚Äôs sour expression.Doris‚Äô parents have always supported her. They‚Äôve never called her a beauty, but they‚Äôve taught her to truly understand what her strong and weak points are. That‚Äôs turned out to be very helpful during her life. Her problems with self-acceptance started when she first went to school. You know how cruel kids can be. She heard nasty comments of every kind ‚Äì mocking, derogatory, and just plain offensive.She even ended up finding some friends after all. Doris has a kind personality, and people like talking to her. But there‚Äôs always another benefit of being friends with a person like her: Doris‚Äô pretty friends looked absolutely stunning in comparison with her. So that was her social role at school ‚Äì ‚Äúthe ugly friend‚Äù, although that definitely sounds better than ‚Äúoutcast‚Äù even if it kills your dignity. Obviously, Doris thought, she wasn‚Äôt going to find a boyfriend ‚Äì never ever. Her normally good spirits started to go down, and she was pretty depressed at the time.And so, Doris was depressed. All of her efforts to improve the situation didn‚Äôt work. No one was attracted to her. But she had always done her best to deal with every situation with humor, because it's easier to survive things by laughing than by suffering. Once, someone witty gave her the nickname ‚ÄúYoda‚Äù, because ‚Äì well you know, from a certain angle they looked like twins. And that‚Äôs what they started calling her at school. She thought it was somehow funny, because no one meant to offend her by calling her it, so she decided to take it to an absurd extreme: She started cosplaying Yoda! She spoke like Yoda, she called everyone ‚Äúyoung padawan‚Äù and was always giving out wise comments. And once for Halloween she went to school dressed as and wearing makeup like master Yoda (not that she needed too much makeup, to be honest). It was an enormous success! Finally, people appreciated her good nature and started laughing with her, not at her!That‚Äôs when she understood that maybe the situation was not so hopeless. She slowly won the hearts of her schoolmates and earned the reputation of school comedian number one. She came to the realization that people are cruel only towards those who are weak and embarrassed, and praise those who are strong and live in peace with their situation. Doris can‚Äôt blame them, that‚Äôs just how psychology works. And that‚Äôs when she thought she could find some benefits in her appearance, even if it seemed impossible. At that time, she‚Äôd had several auditions in drama schools, and had received very good feedback about her comic skill and ‚Äúunusual face‚Äù. Imagine for a moment that everyone is tired of cute faces, and good actresses with non-standard looks are really valued.So now, Doris is finally at peace with herself. After school she wants to go to an acting academy, and she likes to think that her face will be her trademark. She still looks odd, but now she‚Äôs actually proud of her looks, rather than ashamed or depressed.

What software do you use?A. Simon's Cat has been made using a variety of animation software over the years. Originally in Adobe Flash. Then TV Paint (and still on occasions) and most recently using CelAction.Q. Why does it take so long to make each Simon's Cat film?A. Animation is a slow process and Simon‚Äôs Cat films pay particular attention to observed, real life cat behaviour. Historically the films were traditionally animated frame by frame. More recently we use CelAction which has sped up the process but still requires a lot of care and attention. Each film takes approximately 6-9 weeks to make, depending on complexity, number of characters and special effects.#HappyHolidays #SnowballFight"

Quand je l‚Äôai film√©e, je me suis presque endormie.Ensuite, j'ai mang√© la mousse florale s√®che, elle avait un go√ªt bizarre et vraiment sec (NE PAS l'essayer √† la maison).J'ai vers√© de l'eau sur la mousse florale s√®che qui a tout absorb√©.J'ai saupoudr√© de paillettes vertes color√©es √† l'ext√©rieur de la mousse florale.Puis j'ai saupoudr√© les paillettes rouges √† l'int√©rieur.Pour les graines je mets mon doigt dans la mousse florale, c'√©tait vraiment satisfaisant.Apr√®s cela, la mousse florale avec des paillettes ressemblait √† un melon d'eau, alors j'ai un peu faim.J'ai attrap√© la past√®que et l'ai mang√©e, l'eau coulait de l'√©cume florale, comme une vraie past√®que.Diese Videos enthalten ASMR-Sounds wie: Trinken, Schlucken, Essen, Kauen, aber kein Sprechen.WARNUNG: Essen ist NICHT echt, probieren Sie es nicht zu Hause!Ich habe Blumenschaum / Oase im Art Store mit gr√ºnem und rotem Glitter gekauft (Baumarkt).Ich schnitt den Blumenschaum f√ºr die entspannenden und prickelnden ASMR-Kl√§nge ab, als ich ihn filmte, schlief ich fast ein.Dann habe ich den trockenen Blumenschaum gegessen, er schmeckte seltsam und wirklich trocken (probieren Sie das nicht zu Hause).Ich sch√ºttete etwas Wasser auf den trockenen Blumenschaum und er saugte alles Wasser auf.Ich streute etwas bunten gr√ºnen Glitzer auf die Au√üenseite des Blumenschaums.Dann streute ich die roten Glitzer innen.F√ºr die Samen stecke ich meinen Finger in den Blumenschaum, es war wirklich befriedigend.Danach sah der Blumenschaum mit Glitzern aus wie eine Wassermelone, so dass ich etwas hungrig wurde.Ich schnappte mir die Wassermelone und a√ü sie, das Wasser tropfte wie eine echte Wassermelone aus dem Bl√ºtenschaum.Autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR) is a euphoric experience characterized by a static-like or tingling sensation on the skin that typically begins on the scalp and moves down the back of the neck and upper spine, precipitating relaxation."

Today is a highly requested video! I've been building this huge collection of panda bun squishies (thanks to you guys) and it was definitely time to give some of them makeovers!!This is a squishy makeover video, but it's a different format than usual because there are 8 makeovers instead of the typical 3-4. So, these are 8 ways to decorate a panda bun!These are also simpler designs than my usual, but I thought maybe this could be helpful for beginners or anyone who is interested in trying out squishy decorating. Panda buns are a great way to start out since they are so cheap, easy to find and such a simple shape!Here's where you can find some of your own panda buns (AFFILIATE):https://amzn.to/2PsIFxDWATCH THE WHOLE MAKEOVER SERIES: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...Wanna see unedited squishy makeovers, behind the scenes footage, biweekly video updates and get access to exclusive polls and q&as?CHECK OUT MY NEW PATREON: https://www.patreon.com/moriahelizabeth________ Materials List__________http://www.moriah.video/materials.html_________FAQs__________1. CAN I SEND YOU SQUISHIES?So many generous people have sent me their unwanted squishies so I actually have a lot to work on already. BUT if you have squishies that you really don't want anymore, email me at fanmail@moriah.video to request my P.O. box address :).2. ARE SQUISHIES RETURNED TO THE SENDERS AFTER THE MAKEOVER?No. Everyone gave me these squishies as donations to the series because they were no longer wanted. Everyone has been informed in advance that squishies would not be returned. It would be completely impossible for me financially to send back squishies. Just to RECEIVE these squishies costs me hundreds of dollars (I have to pay for P.O. box fees) There are MANY other reasons as well, I explained it in this video if you want to know the full list of reasons: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKYCV...3. WHAT PAINT DO YOU USE?I use fabric paint. Fabric paint is meant to stretch, so it is perfect for squishing! Any brand will work fine, but I mainly use Tulip and Scribbles. You can find it at Michaels, Hobby Lobby, A.C. Moore, Walmart, Joann Fabrics, and Online.4. IS PUFFY PAINT THE SAME AS FABRIC PAINT?Yep!! Puffy paint is just a type of fabric paint.5. WILL FABRIC PAINT CRACK?The matte fabric paint is more likely to crack after lots of squishing. Slick fabric paints never crack. But there are benefits to both. I usually mix the two paints together to get the best of both worlds.6. CAN I USE ACRYLIC PAINT ON SQUISHIES?I would not recommend that. Acrylic paint will either make the squishy hard, or it will crack and flake off. 7. WHAT MEMORY FOAM DO YOU USE?I usually just buy a memory foam pillow on Amazon.com and use that to cut up.8. CAN YOU DO MORE SQUISHIES IN EACH VIDEO OR DO MAKEOVER VIDEOS EVERY WEEK?I wish I could! But these videos take me about 30-50 hours to film and edit (not including waiting for the paint to dry or any breaks). And usually about 8 or 9 days of working on it. So it‚Äôs not really possible to do these any more than I am already doing without lowering the quality. PLUS! I want to keep up with my Monday videos and my art and craft videos as well ‚ò∫9. WHY DO YOU SOMETIMES USE A POPSICLE STICK AND OTHER TIMES USE A PAINTBRUSH TO APPLY PAINT?The ‚Äúslick‚Äù fabric paint has a very thick consistency that does not spread easily with a paint brush. Using a popsicle stick is much easier for this type of paint. BUT the matte fabric paint is much thinner, similar consistency to acrylic paint and it can easily be applied with a paintbrush. When you mix the two, you can get away with a paintbrush as well :)10. WHY DO YOU LIKE RAINBOW SO MUCH?I just like color, and I think rainbows are pretty. There‚Äôs really no other reason for my obsession hahaPURCHASE ME PRODUCTSCREATE THIS BOOK:https://amzn.to/2vUerfICREATE THIS BOOK 2:https://amzn.to/2Nx2G9fME MERCH:https://teespring.com/stores/moriah-elizabethGET TO KNOW MEBECOME A PATRON (GET ACCESS TO EXCLUSIVE CONTENT):https://www.patreon.com/moriahelizabethVISIT ME WEBSITE:http://www.moriah.video/INSTAGRAM: instagram.com/moriahelizabethofficialCONTACT MEEMAIL PICTURES OF YOUR ART:Artwork@Moriah.videoFOR BUSINESS INQUIRIES ONLY:Business@Moriah.video_MAIL ME_For sending squishies, Letters, or general fan mail, please contact: FANMAIL@MORIAH.VIDEO to request my P.O. box address :)MUSIC CREDITS:Intro Music by: SHIFTYPOPMusic: Love Light and Twinkles by JivingGerbil (link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwaUO...)Chee Zee Jungle - Primal Drive by Kevin MacLeod is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)Source: http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1100684Artist: http://incompetech.com/"
