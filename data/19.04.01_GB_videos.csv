We all like shopping, right? You know ‚Äì those moments when you feel down and say to yourself: ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt I just go to the mall and buy everything I want?‚Äù And then you come home with numerous bags containing things you actually don‚Äôt need, but you have a strange feeling of relief? Well, Denise can tell you that sometimes this seemingly innocent habit can become obsessive, and even dangerous.She was in high school when her life suddenly turned into hell. Everything was going perfect ‚Äì a loving family, nice friends, a wonderful boyfriend. When everything is going fine, at some point you start suspecting that it can‚Äôt last forever. And indeed, during her sophomore year, things started crumbling. Her parents had a huge argument and didn‚Äôt talk to each other. She even heard some conversations about a divorce. Denise became nervous because of these family problems, and couldn‚Äôt concentrate on her studies. Her grades went down.Unfortunately, for the first time in her life, Denise had a nervous breakdown, and had no idea how to handle it. The worst thing was that she had no one to confide in ‚Äì her parents had their own problems to deal with, and she had neither a best friend nor a boyfriend anymore. She didn‚Äôt want to bother people who weren‚Äôt very close to her, and she didn‚Äôt want to get too personal with them either. She had only one choice left to her ‚Äì to deal with her problems on her own. Denise found her very own way to decrease her stress levels, which was‚Ä¶shopping!She remembers once how her parents had a particularly heated argument, and she escaped from the house just to be on her own in silence for a while. ‚ÄúWhere can I go?‚Äù she thought. Of course, the mall! Lots of people, crowded shops, food court. A perfect place to hide from your thoughts. It would also be nice to buy herself a couple of new outfits as a distraction from her depressed mood. So that‚Äôs what she did, and she really did forget about her problems completely while she was trying on new jeans and choosing herself a new handbag.She had some money saved, and she had the opportunity to go shopping at least once a week. She was quickly becoming an addict ‚Äì at some point she began to want to buy more things, more often. She was doing it not because she needed anything, but because she wanted those positive emotions she felt when shopping. After a couple of months, Denise realized that she was quickly running out of money, as well as space in her room to keep all the things she was buying. But it didn‚Äôt bother her at all! So, she could dedicate herself to her ‚Äúhobby‚Äù completely.Actually, storage space objectively wasn‚Äôt a big problem ‚Äì she didn‚Äôt even wear what she bought, so she just stored new things wherever she could. Money was a bigger problem ‚Äì she spent all the money she had, and the weekly allowance from her parents wasn‚Äôt enough. She came up with an ingenious solution ‚Äì she started taking cash straight from her mom‚Äôs bag. She certainly wasn‚Äôt proud of herself, but she convinced herself that it was not stealing and that her mom wouldn‚Äôt mind anyway. Of course, it was stealing and now she feels ashamed about it! But at that moment she couldn‚Äôt help it ‚Äì she so needed money for her addiction.But then one day she decided that she needed to GO BIG. She took her dad‚Äôs credit card. What was she thinking?! Her idea was that if she spent just a little bit he wouldn‚Äôt notice. But unfortunately she didn‚Äôt manage to moderate her desires. She spent a huge sum of money, around 500 bucks, and returned the card to his wallet all scared and trembling about what he would do to her when he found out. But a day passed, then three, then five, and he seemed to have not noticed a thing. And she was dying to make another raid around the shops, so she thought, why don‚Äôt I do it just one more time?That time she just couldn‚Äôt stop, she spent and spent and spent without even trying anything on, just buying whatever she could see. Until at some point she heard that phrase that everyone dreads: ‚ÄúSorry, your card was declined‚Äù. Obviously, that was the signal to stop shopping. Of course, she became worried, because why on earth would a credit card be blocked? She got her answer at home when she was greeted by her dad, who was absolutely furious. He had been called by the bank and told that there had been numerous suspicious purchases on his card, and then he noticed that his credit card was missing. Denise decided not to invent any stories, and just told him the truth.Well, at that point her mom and dad finally united to punish her, and it was the turning point when they finally made peace. She got the attention she longed for, and after that particular shock, she didn‚Äôt even feel the urge to go shopping anymore. Now she‚Äôs obsessed with keeping fit. Well...At least it doesn‚Äôt cost money!Music by Epidemic Sound: https://www.epidemicsound.com"

Comment, like, share this story.You all know who Lilly Singh is, right? How could you not? She's an actress, a comedian, a huge YouTube star, and a social media celebrity of the highest degree! She also has a huge heart and believes in empowering young woman (and everybody for that matter) to be their best most powerful selves. Lilly Singh is amazing, and we're sure she always has been BUT before she was famous she was just a kid doing all those things kids do - hanging out with friends and family (she has lots of cousins), playing video games, and finding ways not to be bored, like watching horror movies and telling each other scary stories, and playing with each others imaginations.When she was younger all of her cousins would go to her house to hang out with her and her sister. The parents would all head off to work and the kids would all look after each other - immigranthustle. One day, just after their parents left, they were all piled onto the couch playing video games when the phone rang. Her older cousin answered it, said hello a few times, but nobody was there. Weird, but maybe just a wrong number, or at worst a crank call.Lilly and her cousins got back to their video game, and had played for a little while when the phone rang again. This time another cousin answered and the same thing happened, nobody was on the other end, or at least they weren't saying anything. It was a little scary, what kind of evil demon of a person would do that to a bunch of kids?At that point Lilly and her cousins could have come up with some good rational reasons for the phone calls - like a wrong number, a bad connection, a telemarketer, etc. BUT that's not what a bunch of kids home alone do, so instead they came up with a whole story about how some evil demon or person was trying to get to them and do bad things!They decided they needed a master plan, a way to make sure their story didn't turn out to be a scary horror story. Now, keep in mind, this was right around Christmas and they had just finished doing a Home Alone marathon.They began by documenting all of the calls that came in and capturing  every detail. This would help them come up with their plan for scaring away the evil demon, or whatever - the evil telemarketer. On day three they received more calls than usual and they felt it was definitely a sign. They brainstormed their plan.Was it a robber? A spirit? A demon? The possibilities were endless. Their planning was interrupted when one of their cousins stopped them as said hey, didn't you guys hear that? Now, Lilly hadn't heard anything, but what was the fun of that, and, if there was some demonic Christmas Home Alone presence there with them, she didn't want to be the first to go just because she didn't believe it was real. She wasn't going to be THAT kid in the horror movie. Or one of those ghost stories. It was time to take action. They all gathered up all the utensils from the kitchen drawers and then executed their plan : lock themselves in their parents bedroom and wait it out. But before they locked themselves  in the room they strategically placed three little porcelain pigs in the hallway that could warn them if something trampled that way.Hours went by with them locked in the bedroom, pacing, sweating, stressing and terrified. But, eventually their need for Oreos overcame them so they ventured into the kitchen and felt so relieved, and silly for acting so scared and ridiculous. UNTIL they noticed that one of the little pigs had been knocked over.They freaked out, and around the house, and then finally decided it was time to take a stand - it was either them, or the demon! They searched the entire house with their forks and butter knives ready. But of course, they found nothing.A couple of hours later her parents returned home and all their cousins left. End of story, right? Well, they never felt anymore evil presences, and the phone stopped ringing, but, you never know.

Haunted by an unexplainable and unresolved trauma from her past and compounded by a string of eerie coincidences, Adelaide feels her paranoia elevate to high-alert as she grows increasingly certain that something bad is going to befall her family.After spending a tense beach day with their friends, the Tylers (Emmy winner Elisabeth Moss, Tim Heidecker, Cali Sheldon, Noelle Sheldon), Adelaide and her family return to their vacation home. When darkness falls, the Wilsons discover the silhouette of four figures holding hands as they stand in the driveway. Us pits an endearing American family against a terrifying and uncanny opponent: doppelg√§ngers of themselves. Writer and director Peele produces for his Monkeypaw Productions alongside Sean McKittrick, Jason Blum, and Monkeypaw‚Äôs Ian Cooper. Us will be released by Universal Pictures on Friday, March 15, 2019."

Please see my comments below with regards to reports the video was partially faked.  Go to https://NordVPN.com/MarkRober and use code MARKROBER to get 75% off a 3 year plan and an extra month for free.My buddy Sean posted a video with more details of the build: https://youtu.be/IpMxOmUcfOINote about 2 missing the reactions in the video (I posted this on all my social channels immediately after it happened)- I was presented with information that caused me to doubt the veracity of 2 of the 5 reactions in the video.  These were reactions that were captured during a two week period while the device was at house 2 hours away from where I live.  I put a feeler out for people willing to put a package on their porch and this person (who is a friend of a friend) volunteered to help.  To compensate them for their time and willingness to risk putting a package on their porch I offered financial compensation for any successful recoveries of the package.  It appears (and I've since confirmed) in these two cases, the ‚Äúthieves were actually acquaintances of the person helping me.  From the footage I received from the phones which intentionally only record at specific times, this wasn‚Äôt clear to me. I have since removed those reactions from the original video (originally 6:26-7:59).  I‚Äôm really sorry about this.  Ultimately, I am responsible for the content that goes on my channel and I should have done more here.  I can vouch for that the reactions were genuine when the package was taken from my house.  Having said that, I know my credibility is damaged but I encourage you to look at the types of videos I‚Äôve been making for the past 7 years.  This is my first ever video with some kind of ‚Äúprank and like I mentioned in the video, it‚Äôs pretty removed from my comfort zone and I should have done more.  I‚Äôm especially gutted because so much thought, time, money and effort went into building the device and I hope this doesn‚Äôt just taint the entire effort as ‚Äúfake.  It genuinely works (like all the other things I‚Äôve built on my channel) and we‚Äôve made all the code and build info public.  Again, I‚Äôm sorry for putting something up on my channel that was misleading.  That is totally on me and I will take all necessary steps to make sure it won‚Äôt happen again.High Speed camera courtesy of https://www.aimed-research.com/.

Mr Corbyn pulled a screeching U-turn to move his motion two hours after appearing to abandon it while claiming the threat alone¬†had been enough to make the PM name a new date for the 'meaningful vote' on her Brexit deal. The bizarre sequence of events began at around 3pm when Mr Corbyn's said he would call for a vote if Mrs May did not reschedule the Brexit showdown she postponed last week. Mr Corbyn did not issue his motion when he spoke at 3.45pm - and Labour launched a social media blitz claiming the threat alone had been enough to get a date. Downing Street said it had made no difference and pointed out Mrs May said last week the vote would be held in the New Year and before January 21. Despite claiming victory, Mr Corbyn returned to the Commons at 5.50pm to table his motion anyway.Original Article: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6504533/Corbyn-set-demand-stunt-vote-no-confidence-Theresa-May.htmlOriginal Video: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/video/news/video-1826182/Video-WALKS-House-Commons-Corbyn-calls-vote-no-confidence.htmlDaily Mail Facebook: http://facebook.com/dailymailDaily Mail IG: http://instagram.com/dailymailDaily Mail Snap: https://www.snapchat.com/discover/Daily-Mail/8392137033Daily Mail Twitter: http://twitter.com/MailOnlineDaily Mail Pinterest: http://pinterest.co.uk/dailymailDaily Mail Google+: https://plus.google.com/+DailyMailGet the free Daily Mail mobile app: http://dailymail.co.uk/mobile"

What software do you use?A. Simon's Cat has been made using a variety of animation software over the years. Originally in Adobe Flash. Then TV Paint (and still on occasions) and most recently using CelAction.Q. Why does it take so long to make each Simon's Cat film?A. Animation is a slow process and Simon‚Äôs Cat films pay particular attention to observed, real life cat behaviour. Historically the films were traditionally animated frame by frame. More recently we use CelAction which has sped up the process but still requires a lot of care and attention. Each film takes approximately 6-9 weeks to make, depending on complexity, number of characters and special effects.#HappyHolidays #SnowballFight"

The furnace burns the fuel on a grate for maximum area of air entry. The chimney attached to the furnace is 2 m tall above ground level. The pit is 25 cm cubed and extends below ground level. The whole structure took about 2 weeks to build.A brick of iron oxide (from iron bacteria) mixed with charcoal powder was made and placed in the furnace sitting on a grate about 12.5 cm tall. The furnace was lit with wood and fired. Charcoal was added after this point and a high temperature was reached. The ore brick melted and produced some tiny beads of cast iron.In contrast to the other furnace I made in the previous video, this one produced less iron while consuming the same amount of charcoal. I‚Äôd actually built this furnace before the previous video in an attempt to reduce labour by having a tall draft chimney replace the work and complexity involved with using a blower. I‚Äôll keep experimenting with natural draft furnaces, the principle is sound but the method of introducing the ore (batches of ore on a grate instead of continuous addition of ore pellets) is probably inefficient or could be improved on.About Primitive Technology:Primitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. These are the strict rules: If you want a fire, use a fire stick - An axe, pick up a stone and shape it - A hut, build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without utilizing modern technology. I do not live in the wild, but enjoy building shelter, tools, and more, only utilizing natural materials.
