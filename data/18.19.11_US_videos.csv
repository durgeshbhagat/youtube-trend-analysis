A new trailer, images and poster are now available. The trailer features Colin Farrell, Michael Keaton, Danny DeVito, Eva Green, Finley Hobbins and Nico Parker.Circus owner Max Medici (Danny DeVito) enlists former star Holt Farrier (Colin Farrell) and his children Milly (Nico Parker) and Joe (Finley Hobbins) to care for a newborn elephant whose oversized ears make him a laughingstock in an already struggling circus. But when they discover that Dumbo can fly, the circus makes an incredible comeback, attracting persuasive entrepreneur V.A. Vandevere (Michael Keaton), who recruits the peculiar pachyderm for his newest, larger-than-life entertainment venture, Dreamland. Dumbo soars to new heights alongside a charming and spectacular aerial artist, Colette Marchant (Eva Green), until Holt learns that beneath its shiny veneer, Dreamland is full of dark secrets.Website: https://disney.com/dumboYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/disneymovietrailersFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/DisneyDumbo/Twitter: https://twitter.com/dumboInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dumbo/U.S. Release Date:  March 29, 2019Cast:  Colin Farrell, Michael Keaton, Danny DeVito, Eva Green, Alan Arkin, Finley Hobbins, Nico Parker.Director:  Tim BurtonProducers:  Justin Springer, Ehren Kruger, Katterli Frauenfelder, Derek FreyScreenplay by: Ehren KrugerExecutive Producer: Nigel Gostelow"

He has a problem that maybe you’ve heard about or seen, and which you’ll probably find funny, annoying or creepy. He has Tourette’s syndrome. He’s not ashamed of it – he’s got used to it. Pete wants to tell you how he found a way to turn his condition to his advantage rather than accept it was a problem.He was an absolutely normal kid until one morning when he woke up and felt the urge to twitch his head for no reason. And then do it one more time. And again. He was standing in the center of his bedroom doing strange movements, and he couldn’t control it. Okay, he thought, maybe it’s some muscular spasm and it will pass. It didn’t pass even after several days. What was even worse was that he had a couple of other symptoms. Like raising his hands and winking. And the worst thing was that he wanted to squeak like a pig, like this *squeak*, from time to time, and he didn’t understand why. Of course, all this became pretty noticeable, and he went to see his parents feeling pretty stressed. They took him to the doctor at once, and that’s where he was diagnosed with Tourette’s syndrome.Pete had never heard of it before, and he was certain that if he had seen someone else with these symptoms he would have laughed or been disgusted. And now he had to go to school and explain that this was how he would behave for the time being. He was only ten at the time. He still remembers what it felt like standing among his classmates and saying he had a condition, how embarrassing it felt to constantly move, and his classmates laughing at his every single tic. Sure, it certainly looked like he was having fun, but really, it’s not pleasant or entertaining at all! When he tried to explain that no one actually understood his problem, everyone just thought that it was Pete’s weird way of expressing himself.And that’s how he became isolated from everyone. No one wanted to be around him anymore; and the teachers didn’t even try to give him any support. Even worse, Pete remembers how once his teacher became irritated by his winking – she thought he was just making faces, and put him at the back of the room away from everyone else. There he remained, isolated both physically and psychologically. Pete got to know some other guys with Tourette’s. He thought that he wouldn’t feel so lonely if he got to know other people with the same problem. Unfortunately, Tourette’s is tricky, because when you see other people’s tics, your own tics become worse. And even if a situation like this looks comical in a way, all these tics can be very tiring and debilitating. So Pete came away from these meetings feeling really exhausted, and tried to avoid other Tourette’s sufferers from then on. In the meantime, the situation with his tics was getting worse – more movements appeared, as did more sounds, even abusive language, and in the end he reached his mid-teens looking like a foul-mouthed perpetual motion machine in deep depression.At that time, Pete was browsing a lot on the web, because online no one was disturbed by his tics. One day, he came across a video of a Tourette’s guy who was singing on “The Voice”, and Pete was amazed to see that he performed flawlessly and beautifully, without a single twitch. It was then that he had the idea that maybe he could give it a try himself, and he even knew what he could do. Pete he’d always been quick-witted and had a good sense of humor, so he thought that he could maybe try a couple of times to do stand-up comedy pieces for a small audience, just to get him out of his house a bit.Pete immediately sat himself down to write punchlines, and the ones he came up with made even him laugh. It was so exciting that he completely forgot his depressed state – he was just so drawn into the process. The thing was that his Tourette’s tics could be pretty amusing if he looked at them from an outsider’s perspective, and combined with his comic monologue, the effect was hilarious. And what he wanted to tell people was that having his condition was not a stigma; he wasn’t an idiot or anything, he was just a regular guy.Pete performed his first show surrounded by Tourette’s patients. The effect was even better than he had expected. He got a standing ovation, which was a bit undeserved in his view, but still pleasant. What’s more, Pete learned that he really could control his tics better when he was on stage. He went to the local open mic comic club and performed in front of the locals, who first were taken aback by his strange behavior but by the end of the performance were laughing their heads off. And the most important part was that they were laughing not at him, but with him.He’s now taken his comedy outside the club, and everywhere his audiences like him a lot, while Pete himself feels a lot better – more in control and not so lonely anymore.Music by Epidemic Sound: https://www.epidemicsound.com"

Comment, like, share this story.Buddy never really liked his parents, and they never truly got along. They argued and disagreed and butted heads over almost everything. They didn't see eye-to-eye on politics, to religion, to lifestyle and how to raise good healthy happy kids. Buddy is an atheist, while his parents are very devout Muslims. Buddy is very liberal, while his parents are very conservative. And, Buddy is also unapologetically gay, while his parents, not surprisingly, are extremely homophobic. But, even though on the inside it was really clear that he didn't get along with his parents, he was never very public or vocal about his disagreements with his parents.He still needed a roof over his head, and food to eat, and money in his pocket, and he was afraid that if he shared who he really was and what he really believed too strongly they would kick him out of the house, maybe even disown him. Because of that, he formed what looked like a good relationship with his parents, but it was totally fake and artificial - on the inside, he just didn't get along with them. They saw him as being practically perfect, a good and trustworthy kid, but Buddy saw that his parents were really flawed.His mom liked to hold grudges, was very quick to judge people, and liked to enforce really old fashioned gender roles, like boys should do yard work and take out the trash and that girls only belonged in the kitchen and were destined to become subservient housewives. And his father was so invested and distracted by his work that he never formed and real bonds with his children.He was also upset at the way his four sisters were treated. His parents wouldn't allow his sisters to have any friends over. They weren't allowed to have phones, or do any extra curricular activities, or drive once they reached the age where they could legally get their licenses.And it was even worse with Buddy, especially when he tried to come out to them and tell them he was gay - twice. The first time, his parents begged him to date girls because they saw his coming out as a real threat to them. The second time he tried they just threw out a slew of insults and homophobic falsehoods ranging from the idea that gay people were in fact mentally ill, to the idea that it was a simple choice and he was just making the wrong one. They threatened to disown him and told him he would be a failure in life unless he fixed himself.This all made him so unhappy and he imagined that he would be under the control of his parents for the rest of his life. So, he felt he had to continue to pretend to be the perfect little straight Muslim boy in the house, dating girls and praying and the rest. He didn't think much of it, had been doing it pretty much his whole life, but when he finally confided in his friends they saw it for what it was, miserable and very, very unhealthy. They asked him to imagine what he would be and how he would feel if he was far enough away from them that they couldn't watch his every move, and judge and control him.That was a turning point for him and, realizing his parents were more like prison guards than anything else, he thought of the farthest place he could go without them having a negative impact on him and still be successful and thrive as a young gay man.After doing a little bit of research he concluded that California would be the best place for him -- a thriving LGBT community, a ton of diversity and acceptance, and on the other side of the country from his toxic family life and parents. So, he applied to a few schools in California and, was accepted to attend UCLA! It was one of the happiest moments of his life.His parents were hesitant about it at first, because of how far away it was, but they were happy to have him go to such a highly acclaimed school - that's mostly what they cared about.Since moving to Los Angeles Buddy has never been happier. He is part of a really diverse community with amazing friends, endless support, and a great education. Even though he returns home on Holidays and has to pretend, just like he used to, he is so happy to be out of that toxic house and on his own.His next wish is for his sisters, that they will recognize the truth about their parents, follow in his footsteps, and escape!- - -What's your story?  storybooth wants to hear it!

The film also showcases a wide array of beloved Pokémon characters, each with its own unique abilities and personality.The story begins when ace private eye Harry Goodman goes mysteriously missing, prompting his 21-year-old son Tim to find out what happened. Aiding in the investigation is Harry’s former Pokémon partner, Detective Pikachu: a hilariously wise-cracking, adorable super-sleuth who is a puzzlement even to himself. Finding that they are uniquely equipped to communicate with one another, Tim and Pikachu join forces on a thrilling adventure to unravel the tangled mystery. Chasing clues together through the neon-lit streets of Ryme City—a sprawling, modern metropolis where humans and Pokémon live side by side in a hyper-realistic live-action world—they encounter a diverse cast of Pokémon characters and uncover a shocking plot that could destroy this peaceful co-existence and threaten the whole Pokémon universe.“POKÉMON Detective Pikachu” also stars Justice Smith (“Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom”) as Tim; Kathryn Newton (“Lady Bird,” TV’s “Big Little Lies”) as Lucy, a junior reporter following her first big story; and Oscar nominee Ken Watanabe (“Godzilla,” “The Last Samurai”) as Lt. Yoshida.Directed by Rob Letterman (“Goosebumps,” “Monsters Vs. Aliens”), the “POKÉMON Detective Pikachu” creative filmmaking team includes two-time Oscar nominated director of photography John Mathieson (“The Phantom of the Opera,” “Gladiator”), production designer Nigel Phelps (“Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Lies”) and Oscar-winning editor Mark Sanger (“Gravity”). Visual effects are by Moving Picture Company (“Wonder Woman”) and Framestore (“Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2”).Launched in 1996 to overwhelming response, the Pokémon brand is a global sensation that now encompasses a robust video gaming fandom with over 300 million units sold worldwide; the Pokémon Trading Card Game available in 11 languages with more than 23.6 billion cards shipped; an animated television series in its 21st season that is available in more than 160 countries; and over 20 animated films; as well as books, manga comics, music, toys, merchandise, and apps, including the wildly popular Pokémon GO, that has been downloaded over 850 million times and is enjoyed across the globe by fans of all ages.“POKÉMON Detective Pikachu” is set for release on Friday, May 10, 2019.The film will be distributed outside of Japan and China by Warner Bros. Pictures, in Japan by Toho Company, Ltd. and by Legendary East in China."

I repair, paint and cut away for hours on end to complete these. Hopefully you like them. Get used to lots of rainbow and sprinkles, because I am addicted to both!WATCH THE WHOLE SERIES: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...CHECK OUT MY PATREON: https://www.patreon.com/moriahelizabeth–AGAIN, it is still very new, so not a tons on there yet. MORE TO COME!________ Materials List__________http://www.moriah.video/materials.html_________FAQs__________1. CAN I SEND YOU SQUISHIES?So many generous people have sent me their unwanted squishies so I actually have a lot to work on already 2. ARE SQUISHIES RETURNED TO THE SENDERS AFTER THE MAKEOVER?No. Everyone gave me these squishies as donations to the series because they were no longer wanted. Everyone has been informed in advance that squishies would not be returned. It would be completely impossible for me financially to send back squishies. Just to RECEIVE these squishies costs me hundreds of dollars (I have to pay for P.O. box fees) There are MANY other reasons as well, I explained it in this video if you want to know the full list of reasons: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKYCV...3. WHAT PAINT DO YOU USE?I use fabric paint. Fabric paint is meant to stretch, so it is perfect for squishing! Any brand will work fine, but I mainly use Tulip and Scribbles. You can find it at Michaels, Hobby Lobby, A.C. Moore, Walmart, Joann Fabrics, and Online.4. IS PUFFY PAINT THE SAME AS FABRIC PAINT?Yep!! Puffy paint is just a type of fabric paint.5. WILL FABRIC PAINT CRACK?The matte fabric paint is more likely to crack after lots of squishing. Slick fabric paints never crack. But there are benefits to both. I usually mix the two paints together to get the best of both worlds.6. CAN I USE ACRYLIC PAINT ON SQUISHIES?I would not recommend that. Acrylic paint will either make the squishy hard, or it will crack and flake off. 7. WHAT MEMORY FOAM DO YOU USE?I usually just buy a memory foam pillow on Amazon.com and use that to cut up.8. CAN YOU DO MORE SQUISHIES IN EACH VIDEO OR DO MAKEOVER VIDEOS EVERY WEEK?I wish I could! But these videos take me about 30-50 hours to film and edit (not including waiting for the paint to dry or any breaks). And usually about 8 or 9 days of working on it. So it’s not really possible to do these any more than I am already doing without lowering the quality. PLUS! I want to keep up with my Monday videos and my art and craft videos as well ☺9. WHY DO YOU SOMETIMES USE A POPSICLE STICK AND OTHER TIMES USE A PAINTBRUSH TO APPLY PAINT?The “slick” fabric paint has a very thick consistency that does not spread easily with a paint brush. Using a popsicle stick is much easier for this type of paint. BUT the matte fabric paint is much thinner, similar consistency to acrylic paint and it can easily be applied with a paintbrush. When you mix the two, you can get away with a paintbrush as well :)10. WHY DO YOU LIKE RAINBOW SO MUCH?I just like color, and I think rainbows are pretty. There’s really no other reason for my obsession hahaMY CURRENT UPLOAD SCHEDULE:Every Friday at 4:00pm ET: Squishy Makeovers (roughly every other Friday), Thrift Makeovers, Craft Kits and Miscellaneous crafts and DIYsANDEvery Other Monday:  Squishy Updates, Create This Book episodes, mail openings/unboxings, announcements, experiments or any other weirdness I come up with...BUY CREATE THIS BOOK:https://amzn.to/2vUerfIBUY CREATE THIS BOOK 2:https://amzn.to/2Nx2G9fVISIT MY WEBSITE:http://www.moriah.video/MY MERCH:https://teespring.com/stores/moriah-elizabethINSTAGRAM: instagram.com/moriahelizabethofficialEMAIL ME PICTURES OF YOUR ART:Artwork@Moriah.videoFOR BUSINESS INQUIRIES ONLY:Business@Moriah.video*INTRO MUSIC BY SHIFTYPOP*"

Police said they have identified the gunman but did not give out a name. Authorities said the gunfire broke out at the Borderline Bar & Grill, a country-western dance bar in Thousand Oaks, which is about 40 miles west of Los Angeles. Hundreds of people fled in terror, including some who used bar stools to break windows and escape.It’s a horrific scene in there,” Ventura County Sheriff Geoff Dean told a news conference in the parking lot of the bar. “There’s blood everywhere.”A law enforcement official told The Associated Press the suspect was 29 years old, armed with a .45-caliber handgun and used a smoke device. The official declined to provide any other details, speaking on condition of anonymity for lack of authorization to publicly discuss the investigation.Dean said it was not immediately clear how the gunman died."

Gus liked shooting in the basement, and in the garage. He liked playing with atmosphere.  In this one, he was playing with light and shadow.  He was also very proud of his new glasses.

Spending 11 days in the Amazon rainforest, at 17 years old, she had to remain mentally strong gathering all of her strength and her will to survive. A true story, Juliane only had 1 shoe and 1 eye to see out of. Being separated from the entire plane wreckage, she knew she had to find her way out if she wanted to survive. The thick Amazon rainforest made it difficult for rescues to find the plane, let alone her! She tried so desperately to find her mother, but in her fragile state, she had to worry about herself first. Not knowing if she would ever be found, she took a chance and followed a river hoping it would be her shot at finding people. Her gamble paid off when she managed to find a resting post where the next day, people found her and quickly transported her to a hospital. Out of 91 passengers, she is the only survivor of the Lansa Flight 508. She not only survived a plane crash but survived it falling nearly 3 1/2 Burj Khalifa's (tallest building in the world) without any life-threatening injuries and survived 11 days on her own in the Amazon rainforest. Showing the will to survive, her story shows us how strong, resilient, and determined someone can be when faced with the most difficult challenges."

But unlike most teenagers, she spends much of her time living in a hospital as a cystic fibrosis patient. Her life is full of routines, boundaries and self-control -- all of which is put to the test when she meets an impossibly charming fellow CF patient named Will Newman (Cole Sprouse).There’s an instant flirtation, though restrictions dictate that they must maintain a safe distance between them. As their connection intensifies, so does the temptation to throw the rules out the window and embrace that attraction. Further complicating matters is Will’s potentially dangerous rebellion against his ongoing medical treatment. Stella gradually inspires Will to live life to the fullest, but can she ultimately save the person she loves when even a single touch is off limits?#FiveFeetApart // IN THEATERS EVERYWHERE MARCH 22, 2019"

But when events take an unexpected turn, Walter and Lance suddenly have to rely on each other in a whole new way. And if this odd couple can’t learn to work as a team, the whole world is in peril.

(好きになっちゃうだろう？)’, 마지막화에서 공개된 단체곡 ‘꿈을 꾸는 동안’ , ‘PRODUCE48’의 메인 테마곡 ‘내꺼야’의 ‘IZ*ONE(아이즈원)’ 버전 등이 새롭게 수록 돼 ‘PRODUCE48’부터 아이즈원을 지켜본 이들이라면 새로운 매력을 느낄 수 있다. 데뷔 미니 앨범 ＜COLOR*IZ＞를  시작으로 아이즈원 멤버들이 전 세계를 향해 보여줄 12가지 색깔의 매력을 지켜 보자."
