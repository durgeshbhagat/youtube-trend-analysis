She’ll tell it to you straight: she’s the opposite of good-looking. That is, she’s simply ugly. It’s not that she’s an attention-seeker or anything who wants to hear things like “Oh no, Dory, you’re so pretty, don’t say that!” In her opinion, no one in their right mind would call her pretty.Your looks are a genetic lottery, as they say. And in Doris’ case, she didn’t get a single correct number called out. Both her parents look fine, and no one knows whom she takes after. She’s also totally healthy, has no impairments or deformations, and it’s only her face that startles people. Her older brother also looks fine, just like her parents.Doris would be happy to tell you that she’s now accustomed to seeing her reflection, but in actual fact, even now she wants to call the exorcist every time she sees herself in the mirror. However, it feels so nice that she can be humorous about it now instead of telling a dramatic story full of suffering. But she hasn’t always had this relaxed attitude towards herself. As you can imagine, over the years she’s compiled a truly golden compilation of “motivational” phrases and insults that an ugly person might receive throughout their life. When she was little, it was a bit easier to live with her looks. Toddlers normally don’t notice such things. But their parents do. She still remembers some of the comments that were expressed to her parents when they were in a play park: “Oh, it’s much more important for a girl to be nice and pleasant than to have good looks, isn’t it?” And she remembers seeing her mom’s sour expression.Doris’ parents have always supported her. They’ve never called her a beauty, but they’ve taught her to truly understand what her strong and weak points are. That’s turned out to be very helpful during her life. Her problems with self-acceptance started when she first went to school. You know how cruel kids can be. She heard nasty comments of every kind – mocking, derogatory, and just plain offensive.She even ended up finding some friends after all. Doris has a kind personality, and people like talking to her. But there’s always another benefit of being friends with a person like her: Doris’ pretty friends looked absolutely stunning in comparison with her. So that was her social role at school – “the ugly friend”, although that definitely sounds better than “outcast” even if it kills your dignity. Obviously, Doris thought, she wasn’t going to find a boyfriend – never ever. Her normally good spirits started to go down, and she was pretty depressed at the time.And so, Doris was depressed. All of her efforts to improve the situation didn’t work. No one was attracted to her. But she had always done her best to deal with every situation with humor, because it's easier to survive things by laughing than by suffering. Once, someone witty gave her the nickname “Yoda”, because – well you know, from a certain angle they looked like twins. And that’s what they started calling her at school. She thought it was somehow funny, because no one meant to offend her by calling her it, so she decided to take it to an absurd extreme: She started cosplaying Yoda! She spoke like Yoda, she called everyone “young padawan” and was always giving out wise comments. And once for Halloween she went to school dressed as and wearing makeup like master Yoda (not that she needed too much makeup, to be honest). It was an enormous success! Finally, people appreciated her good nature and started laughing with her, not at her!That’s when she understood that maybe the situation was not so hopeless. She slowly won the hearts of her schoolmates and earned the reputation of school comedian number one. She came to the realization that people are cruel only towards those who are weak and embarrassed, and praise those who are strong and live in peace with their situation. Doris can’t blame them, that’s just how psychology works. And that’s when she thought she could find some benefits in her appearance, even if it seemed impossible. At that time, she’d had several auditions in drama schools, and had received very good feedback about her comic skill and “unusual face”. Imagine for a moment that everyone is tired of cute faces, and good actresses with non-standard looks are really valued.So now, Doris is finally at peace with herself. After school she wants to go to an acting academy, and she likes to think that her face will be her trademark. She still looks odd, but now she’s actually proud of her looks, rather than ashamed or depressed. And that’s what she wants to tell anyone who feels embarrassed by their own peculiarities – be proud of who you are rather than ashamed, and may the Force be with you, young padawan!

What software do you use?A. Simon's Cat has been made using a variety of animation software over the years. Originally in Adobe Flash. Then TV Paint (and still on occasions) and most recently using CelAction.Q. Why does it take so long to make each Simon's Cat film?A. Animation is a slow process and Simon’s Cat films pay particular attention to observed, real life cat behaviour. Historically the films were traditionally animated frame by frame. More recently we use CelAction which has sped up the process but still requires a lot of care and attention. Each film takes approximately 6-9 weeks to make, depending on complexity, number of characters and special effects.#HappyHolidays #SnowballFight"

It's in a beautiful and peaceful area where the noodles flow in a long bamboo stick with clear and cold running water through it. But you have to be fast and on your guard for your noodles because they slide by pretty quick!Then I thought I'd try out some cool Samurai food that was once eaten by actual Samurai's. For Samurai's to stay healthy and fit they ate a lot of vegetables, and I thought it was pretty good although I don't really eat veggies. And to end my fun food day, I went to grab some Okonomu-Yaki. I have to say Manmaru No Tsuki served up some amazing foods here.Locations:✧ Hirobunhttps://bit.ly/2RRMKgG✧ Shishin Samurai Restauranthttps://bit.ly/2L8S24Z✧ Manmaru No Tsukihttps://bit.ly/2zSp9Wm***MORE EXCLUSIVE Content on Instagram***✩ http://instagr.am/Mikexingchen✩ http://instagr.am/haveadumpling➔ Get tickets to the best show on earth!!! http://bit.ly/2gu7REI✸ Strictly Dumpling T-Shirts HERE: http://bit.ly/2IVM2ts➣ Subscribe for MORE videos about food! http://bit.ly/1hsxh41➣ Subscribe to our COOKING Channel! http://bit.ly/2vz2UPT------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------★↓FOLLOW ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA!↓★Facebook Show Page: https://www.facebook.com/strictlydumplingFacebook Mike Fan Page: https://www.facebook.com/mikeychenxStrictly Dumpling Instagram: http://instagr.am/haveadumplingPersonal Instagram: http://instagr.am/MikexingchenTwitter: http://twitter.com/MikexingchenTwitch: https://www.twitch.tv/mikexchen◈ Equipment I use for filming◈ :Sony RX100 Mark V: https://go.magik.ly/ml/cgc5/PANASONIC LUMIX G85: https://go.magik.ly/ml/cgcd/Wide Angle Lens: https://go.magik.ly/ml/cgck/Camera Mic: https://go.magik.ly/ml/cgcn/Camera Lights: https://go.magik.ly/ml/cgcq/Handheld Audio Recorder: https://go.magik.ly/ml/cgcr/Tripod: https://go.magik.ly/ml/cgcu/Drone: https://go.magik.ly/ml/cgcx/My Favorite Cookware！wok/pan http://amzn.to/2f5G0upAlso this pan http://amzn.to/2f5QnyiPressure pan http://amzn.to/2wJIS7uNonstick pot http://amzn.to/2wHRgq1-------------------------------------✉ Send stuff to our P.O.

Quand je l’ai filmée, je me suis presque endormie.Ensuite, j'ai mangé la mousse florale sèche, elle avait un goût bizarre et vraiment sec (NE PAS l'essayer à la maison).J'ai versé de l'eau sur la mousse florale sèche qui a tout absorbé.J'ai saupoudré de paillettes vertes colorées à l'extérieur de la mousse florale.Puis j'ai saupoudré les paillettes rouges à l'intérieur.Pour les graines je mets mon doigt dans la mousse florale, c'était vraiment satisfaisant.Après cela, la mousse florale avec des paillettes ressemblait à un melon d'eau, alors j'ai un peu faim.J'ai attrapé la pastèque et l'ai mangée, l'eau coulait de l'écume florale, comme une vraie pastèque.Diese Videos enthalten ASMR-Sounds wie: Trinken, Schlucken, Essen, Kauen, aber kein Sprechen.WARNUNG: Essen ist NICHT echt, probieren Sie es nicht zu Hause!Ich habe Blumenschaum / Oase im Art Store mit grünem und rotem Glitter gekauft (Baumarkt).Ich schnitt den Blumenschaum für die entspannenden und prickelnden ASMR-Klänge ab, als ich ihn filmte, schlief ich fast ein.Dann habe ich den trockenen Blumenschaum gegessen, er schmeckte seltsam und wirklich trocken (probieren Sie das nicht zu Hause).Ich schüttete etwas Wasser auf den trockenen Blumenschaum und er saugte alles Wasser auf.Ich streute etwas bunten grünen Glitzer auf die Außenseite des Blumenschaums.Dann streute ich die roten Glitzer innen.Für die Samen stecke ich meinen Finger in den Blumenschaum, es war wirklich befriedigend.Danach sah der Blumenschaum mit Glitzern aus wie eine Wassermelone, so dass ich etwas hungrig wurde.Ich schnappte mir die Wassermelone und aß sie, das Wasser tropfte wie eine echte Wassermelone aus dem Blütenschaum.Autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR) is a euphoric experience characterized by a static-like or tingling sensation on the skin that typically begins on the scalp and moves down the back of the neck and upper spine, precipitating relaxation."

Comment, like, share this story.Bella lives in a neighborhood called Squirrel Hill in Pittsburgh. She's grown up there, lived there her whole life, has her friends and her synagogue there, right near the Tree of Life synagogue, and it had always been a peaceful neighborhood - diverse and accepting - a really nice place to live. There were a lot of Jewish families who lived there and she could hardly remember any anti semitism ever happening around them.But, on Saturday, October 27th, she slept in late and only woke up when her mom called to her from the other room at around eleven o'clock. She ran in to her Mom's room and her younger sister was there and they looked awful, pale, afraid and scared. Bella didn't know what was going on, and her mom would only whisper because she didn't want Bella's youngest sister to wake up. But something really, really bad was going on - you could tell from the terrified looks on her Mom and sister.Her mom asked is she'd looked at her phone yet, if she'd seen or heard any of what was on the news. She'd heard lots of sirens in her half sleep, but they didn't wake her - what was going on? Her mom sat her down and told her that there had been a mass shooting at a temple - the Tree of Life synagogue right there in squirrel hill. Bella gasped and sat down hard. She was so scared, afraid, shaking and crying. She was just in shock that something like this had happened, in their neighborhood, at a synagogue that was practically right next to the one she attended. Also, the fact that it was all because of their religion, all because they were Jewish, and this scared Bella too - the ant-semitism, and all these shootings taking place everywhere.What made the tragedy even worse was the fact that it was Shabbat, the holiest day of the week for the Jewish people -- all they were doing was praying -- and that morning the Tree of Life synagogue was having a baby naming for a new baby just born into their community, a special and festive and happy occasion. And an evil man full of hate and anti semitism came into their place of worship and shot and killed 11 people, including police and security guards.When Bella and her friends returned to their religious school, hebrew school, so many of them were on edge, scared, and couldn't quite put into words how awful and vulnerable it made them feel. Why was there anti semitism, or hate of any kind? Why couldn't people coexist without hatred and gun violence?After they had started their school day they had a special morning prayer service and they invited the congregation from the Tree of Life synagogue to join them. There were so many people there, mourning and praying, holding hands and supporting each other - praying for peace, and love, and for the souls of the those who passed to ascend. And they chanted and sang words of power, that they were strong and that they would not be afraid.The Pittsburgh synagogue shooting has effected jews all over the United States and the world, and all people who enjoy feeling safe and free to worship how they choose under any religion they choose. Hopefully the families affected by this tragedy will be able to feel one day that those they lost did not die in vain and that they re-awakened the need for peace, and love, and light across the entire world._____What's your story?  storybooth wants to hear it!  actually happenedLINKS:Website: http://www.storybooth.comInstagram: @thestorybooth twitter @thestorybooth https://www.instagram.com/thestoryboothG+: https://plus.google.com/+StoryboothFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/thestorybooth/Tumblr: https://storybooth.tumblr.com/If you liked this storybooth animation and love storytime / story time story booth kid videos, watch our themed playlist collections:Being Yourself: https://goo.gl/89enENLove and Heartbreak: https://goo.gl/mfaoKwEmbarrassing and Funny: https://goo.gl/5GjxrWBullies and Mean People:https://goo.gl/THS3LBOvercoming Challenges: https://goo.gl/pbxRa9#storybooth #storyboothOnlyTrueStories"

I combined the two days because things didn’t work out as planned on Day 9, and so didn’t end up being able to film much. But that’s the way things go sometimes!So firstly, on Day 9, the plan was to drive from Shigar to to Deosai National Park, and drive all the way through the park to the other side, en-route to Gilgit. Unfortunately it started snowing along the way, and by the time we arrived to the entrance of the park, it was snowing too hard, and it was too risky to proceed. So we turned around and took the long way to Gilgit.Gilgit, Gilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan - Ok, so now back to today (Day 10) we started the morning with a street food tour of Gilgit. Gilgit is an amazing small town, sort of the gateway of Gilgit Baltistan, and a commerce hub for the region on the Karakoram highway. The town is extremely friendly, and everywhere we went to eat on this small market and street food tour, we were greeted with such friendliness and hospitality.Kabuli pulao - 140 PKR ($1.04)Grilled meat - 120 PKR ($0.89)Curry - 120 PKR ($0.89)After about an hour eating street food and walking around the market, we continued on to Nizam’s house, which was about a 15 minute drive from the center of Gilgit. Nizam is an employee of Ali, and he graciously invited us to his amazing home in the countryside. The view from the backyard was breathtaking.We first went to the river valley to pick vegetables where we met Nizam’s father in law, who again may be the happiest man on earth - he was amazing pounding the chilies. We picked vegetables, and just stood in amazement at the natural wonder beauty of Pakistan. Lunch was incredibly delicious, all the fresh vegetables we picked, plus both mutton and beef curry, with rice and roti. The curries were some of the best I ate in Pakistan, but the fresh mountain vegetables, sauteed down with dried tomato, were the highlight. An incredible meal, really one of the most memorable I had in my entire trip to Pakistan.Thank you Nizam and family for the amazing meal!Watch the entire Pakistani video series: https://youtu.be/Xdya8eym9nMAli: https://goo.gl/VY6NjHJoel: https://goo.gl/5AkWm6MUSIC: https://us.audionetwork.com/Logo: https://goo.gl/VhaLp5CAMERA GEAR I used to make this video (these are affiliate links):Main camera: http://amzn.to/2sV0XQOMain lens: http://amzn.to/2szLZNf2nd lens: http://amzn.to/2EjBeEgMicrophone: http://amzn.to/2rBKD3zDrone: http://amzn.to/2CrtAHzFOLLOW:Instagram: @migrationologyFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationologyThank you for watching!"

Today is a highly requested video! I've been building this huge collection of panda bun squishies (thanks to you guys) and it was definitely time to give some of them makeovers!!This is a squishy makeover video, but it's a different format than usual because there are 8 makeovers instead of the typical 3-4. So, these are 8 ways to decorate a panda bun!These are also simpler designs than my usual, but I thought maybe this could be helpful for beginners or anyone who is interested in trying out squishy decorating. Panda buns are a great way to start out since they are so cheap, easy to find and such a simple shape!Here's where you can find some of your own panda buns (AFFILIATE):https://amzn.to/2PsIFxDWATCH THE WHOLE MAKEOVER SERIES: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...Wanna see unedited squishy makeovers, behind the scenes footage, biweekly video updates and get access to exclusive polls and q&as?CHECK OUT MY NEW PATREON: https://www.patreon.com/moriahelizabeth________ Materials List__________http://www.moriah.video/materials.html_________FAQs__________1. CAN I SEND YOU SQUISHIES?So many generous people have sent me their unwanted squishies so I actually have a lot to work on already. BUT if you have squishies that you really don't want anymore, email me at fanmail@moriah.video to request my P.O. box address :).2. ARE SQUISHIES RETURNED TO THE SENDERS AFTER THE MAKEOVER?No. Everyone gave me these squishies as donations to the series because they were no longer wanted. Everyone has been informed in advance that squishies would not be returned. It would be completely impossible for me financially to send back squishies. Just to RECEIVE these squishies costs me hundreds of dollars (I have to pay for P.O. box fees) There are MANY other reasons as well, I explained it in this video if you want to know the full list of reasons: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKYCV...3. WHAT PAINT DO YOU USE?I use fabric paint. Fabric paint is meant to stretch, so it is perfect for squishing! Any brand will work fine, but I mainly use Tulip and Scribbles. You can find it at Michaels, Hobby Lobby, A.C. Moore, Walmart, Joann Fabrics, and Online.4. IS PUFFY PAINT THE SAME AS FABRIC PAINT?Yep!! Puffy paint is just a type of fabric paint.5. WILL FABRIC PAINT CRACK?The matte fabric paint is more likely to crack after lots of squishing. Slick fabric paints never crack. But there are benefits to both. I usually mix the two paints together to get the best of both worlds.6. CAN I USE ACRYLIC PAINT ON SQUISHIES?I would not recommend that. Acrylic paint will either make the squishy hard, or it will crack and flake off. 7. WHAT MEMORY FOAM DO YOU USE?I usually just buy a memory foam pillow on Amazon.com and use that to cut up.8. CAN YOU DO MORE SQUISHIES IN EACH VIDEO OR DO MAKEOVER VIDEOS EVERY WEEK?I wish I could! But these videos take me about 30-50 hours to film and edit (not including waiting for the paint to dry or any breaks). And usually about 8 or 9 days of working on it. So it’s not really possible to do these any more than I am already doing without lowering the quality. PLUS! I want to keep up with my Monday videos and my art and craft videos as well ☺9. WHY DO YOU SOMETIMES USE A POPSICLE STICK AND OTHER TIMES USE A PAINTBRUSH TO APPLY PAINT?The “slick” fabric paint has a very thick consistency that does not spread easily with a paint brush. Using a popsicle stick is much easier for this type of paint. BUT the matte fabric paint is much thinner, similar consistency to acrylic paint and it can easily be applied with a paintbrush. When you mix the two, you can get away with a paintbrush as well :)10. WHY DO YOU LIKE RAINBOW SO MUCH?I just like color, and I think rainbows are pretty. There’s really no other reason for my obsession hahaPURCHASE ME PRODUCTSCREATE THIS BOOK:https://amzn.to/2vUerfICREATE THIS BOOK 2:https://amzn.to/2Nx2G9fME MERCH:https://teespring.com/stores/moriah-elizabethGET TO KNOW MEBECOME A PATRON (GET ACCESS TO EXCLUSIVE CONTENT):https://www.patreon.com/moriahelizabethVISIT ME WEBSITE:http://www.moriah.video/INSTAGRAM: instagram.com/moriahelizabethofficialCONTACT MEEMAIL PICTURES OF YOUR ART:Artwork@Moriah.videoFOR BUSINESS INQUIRIES ONLY:Business@Moriah.video_MAIL ME_For sending squishies, Letters, or general fan mail, please contact: FANMAIL@MORIAH.VIDEO to request my P.O. box address :)MUSIC CREDITS:Intro Music by: SHIFTYPOPMusic: Love Light and Twinkles by JivingGerbil (link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwaUO...)Chee Zee Jungle - Primal Drive by Kevin MacLeod is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)Source: http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1100684Artist: http://incompetech.com/"

She references four romantic comedies from the 2000s: Mean Girls, 13 Going on 30, Legally Blonde, and Bring it On. Plus, the video features cameos from Kris Jenner to Ari's best friends and former castmates from the Nickelodeon show Victorious. But there's so much more, and we uncover it all.In the video, Grande embodies a main character from each film, played by Rachel McAdams, Reese Witherspoon, Jennifer Garner, and Kirsten Dunst.Grande even has her own Burn Book about her exes — Pete Davidson, Ricky Alvarez, Big Sean, and Mac Miller — though she only wrote positive comments.Famous faces include Jonathan Bennett, Colleen Ballinger, Stefanie Drummond, Troye Sivan, Gabi DeMartino, Elizabeth Gillies, Kris Jenner, Robbie Shapiro, Daniella Monet, Ari's dog Toulouse, and Jennifer Coolidge.Read more: https://www.thisisinsider.com/ariana-grande-thank-u-next-music-video-mean-girls-legally-blonde-13-going-on-30-bring-it-on-2018-11------------------------------------------------------INSIDER is great journalism about what passionate people actually want to know.

Watch BTS (방탄소년단) LOVE YOURSELF 結 Answer 'Epiphany' Comeback Trailer here: https://youtu.be/fIkZOLsnoqYFilmed at https://thefifthfloorutah.comWho are The Piano Guys?Since formally introducing themselves in 2011 on YouTube, The Piano Guys – Steven Sharp Nelson (Cellist/Songwriter), Jon Schmidt (Pianist/Songwriter), Al Van der Beek (Music Producer/Songwriter) and Paul Anderson (Video Producer/Entrepreneur) – unassumingly arrived as a musical phenomenon. Over the course of five studio records, two Christmas releases, and a fan favorite live album, they have impressively tallied 2 billion-plus global streams, clocked upwards of 1.6 billion YouTube views, earned six No. 1 debuts on the Billboard Top Classical Albums Chart, sold out concerts in almost every corner of the world, averaged nearly 2 million monthly listeners on Spotify, and attracted a diehard audience. Not to mention, they’ve appeared in The New York Times, Fast Company, BuzzFeed, Mashable, and People, were featured on CBS Sunday Morning and performed on the TODAY Show, Good Morning America and The Tonight Show. Their latest album, Limitless catapulted to the top of the charts, holding the No. 1 spot on iTunes, Apple Music and Amazon classical charts.  With over 28 million digital streams worldwide, the newest release from The Piano Guys lives up to the name Limitless as the foursome once again leap past boundaries for the 13-track collection.  Limitless features the guys’ take on the latest pop hits – from Shawn Mendes to Ed Sheeran to Coldplay and The Chainsmokers, The Piano Guys continue to break new ground, even exploring the K-Pop world with two BTS covers.  Rounding out the collection are two tracks from the box office hit The Greatest Showman as well as four new original compositions, culminating in a diverse new album with massive multigenerational appeal.
