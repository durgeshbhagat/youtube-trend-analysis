The film also showcases a wide array of beloved Pokémon characters, each with its own unique abilities and personality.The story begins when ace private eye Harry Goodman goes mysteriously missing, prompting his 21-year-old son Tim to find out what happened. Aiding in the investigation is Harry’s former Pokémon partner, Detective Pikachu: a hilariously wise-cracking, adorable super-sleuth who is a puzzlement even to himself. Finding that they are uniquely equipped to communicate with one another, Tim and Pikachu join forces on a thrilling adventure to unravel the tangled mystery. Chasing clues together through the neon-lit streets of Ryme City—a sprawling, modern metropolis where humans and Pokémon live side by side in a hyper-realistic live-action world—they encounter a diverse cast of Pokémon characters and uncover a shocking plot that could destroy this peaceful co-existence and threaten the whole Pokémon universe.“POKÉMON Detective Pikachu” also stars Justice Smith (“Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom”) as Tim; Kathryn Newton (“Lady Bird,” TV’s “Big Little Lies”) as Lucy, a junior reporter following her first big story; and Oscar nominee Ken Watanabe (“Godzilla,” “The Last Samurai”) as Lt. Yoshida.Directed by Rob Letterman (“Goosebumps,” “Monsters Vs. Aliens”), the “POKÉMON Detective Pikachu” creative filmmaking team includes two-time Oscar nominated director of photography John Mathieson (“The Phantom of the Opera,” “Gladiator”), production designer Nigel Phelps (“Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Lies”) and Oscar-winning editor Mark Sanger (“Gravity”). Visual effects are by Moving Picture Company (“Wonder Woman”) and Framestore (“Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2”).Launched in 1996 to overwhelming response, the Pokémon brand is a global sensation that now encompasses a robust video gaming fandom with over 300 million units sold worldwide; the Pokémon Trading Card Game available in 11 languages with more than 23.6 billion cards shipped; an animated television series in its 21st season that is available in more than 160 countries; and over 20 animated films; as well as books, manga comics, music, toys, merchandise, and apps, including the wildly popular Pokémon GO, that has been downloaded over 850 million times and is enjoyed across the globe by fans of all ages.“POKÉMON Detective Pikachu” is set for release on Friday, May 10, 2019.The film will be distributed outside of Japan and China by Warner Bros. Pictures, in Japan by Toho Company, Ltd. and by Legendary East in China."

MORE TO COME!________ Materials List__________http://www.moriah.video/materials.html_________FAQs__________1. CAN I SEND YOU SQUISHIES?So many generous people have sent me their unwanted squishies so I actually have a lot to work on already 2. ARE SQUISHIES RETURNED TO THE SENDERS AFTER THE MAKEOVER?No. Everyone gave me these squishies as donations to the series because they were no longer wanted. Everyone has been informed in advance that squishies would not be returned. It would be completely impossible for me financially to send back squishies. Just to RECEIVE these squishies costs me hundreds of dollars (I have to pay for P.O. box fees) There are MANY other reasons as well, I explained it in this video if you want to know the full list of reasons: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKYCV...3. WHAT PAINT DO YOU USE?I use fabric paint. Fabric paint is meant to stretch, so it is perfect for squishing! Any brand will work fine, but I mainly use Tulip and Scribbles. You can find it at Michaels, Hobby Lobby, A.C. Moore, Walmart, Joann Fabrics, and Online.4. IS PUFFY PAINT THE SAME AS FABRIC PAINT?Yep!! Puffy paint is just a type of fabric paint.5. WILL FABRIC PAINT CRACK?The matte fabric paint is more likely to crack after lots of squishing. Slick fabric paints never crack. But there are benefits to both. I usually mix the two paints together to get the best of both worlds.6. CAN I USE ACRYLIC PAINT ON SQUISHIES?I would not recommend that. Acrylic paint will either make the squishy hard, or it will crack and flake off. 7. WHAT MEMORY FOAM DO YOU USE?I usually just buy a memory foam pillow on Amazon.com and use that to cut up.8. CAN YOU DO MORE SQUISHIES IN EACH VIDEO OR DO MAKEOVER VIDEOS EVERY WEEK?I wish I could! But these videos take me about 30-50 hours to film and edit (not including waiting for the paint to dry or any breaks). And usually about 8 or 9 days of working on it. So it’s not really possible to do these any more than I am already doing without lowering the quality. PLUS! I want to keep up with my Monday videos and my art and craft videos as well ☺9. WHY DO YOU SOMETIMES USE A POPSICLE STICK AND OTHER TIMES USE A PAINTBRUSH TO APPLY PAINT?The “slick” fabric paint has a very thick consistency that does not spread easily with a paint brush. Using a popsicle stick is much easier for this type of paint. BUT the matte fabric paint is much thinner, similar consistency to acrylic paint and it can easily be applied with a paintbrush. When you mix the two, you can get away with a paintbrush as well :)10. WHY DO YOU LIKE RAINBOW SO MUCH?I just like color, and I think rainbows are pretty. There’s really no other reason for my obsession hahaMY CURRENT UPLOAD SCHEDULE:Every Friday at 4:00pm ET: Squishy Makeovers (roughly every other Friday), Thrift Makeovers, Craft Kits and Miscellaneous crafts and DIYsANDEvery Other Monday:  Squishy Updates, Create This Book episodes, mail openings/unboxings, announcements, experiments or any other weirdness I come up with...BUY CREATE THIS BOOK:https://amzn.to/2vUerfIBUY CREATE THIS BOOK 2:https://amzn.to/2Nx2G9fVISIT MY WEBSITE:http://www.moriah.video/MY MERCH:https://teespring.com/stores/moriah-elizabethINSTAGRAM: instagram.com/moriahelizabethofficialFOR BUSINESS INQUIRIES OR Create This Book/Craft photos ONLY:MoriahElizabeth15@gmail.com*INTRO MUSIC BY SHIFTYPOP*"

Hundreds of people fled in terror, including some who used bar stools to break windows and escape.It’s a horrific scene in there,” Ventura County Sheriff Geoff Dean told a news conference in the parking lot of the bar. “There’s blood everywhere.”A law enforcement official told The Associated Press the suspect was 29 years old, armed with a .45-caliber handgun and used a smoke device. The official declined to provide any other details, speaking on condition of anonymity for lack of authorization to publicly discuss the investigation.Dean said it was not immediately clear how the gunman died."

Gus liked shooting in the basement, and in the garage. He liked playing with atmosphere.  In this one, he was playing with light and shadow.  He was also very proud of his new glasses.

Spending 11 days in the Amazon rainforest, at 17 years old, she had to remain mentally strong gathering all of her strength and her will to survive. A true story, Juliane only had 1 shoe and 1 eye to see out of. Being separated from the entire plane wreckage, she knew she had to find her way out if she wanted to survive. The thick Amazon rainforest made it difficult for rescues to find the plane, let alone her! She tried so desperately to find her mother, but in her fragile state, she had to worry about herself first. Not knowing if she would ever be found, she took a chance and followed a river hoping it would be her shot at finding people. Her gamble paid off when she managed to find a resting post where the next day, people found her and quickly transported her to a hospital. Out of 91 passengers, she is the only survivor of the Lansa Flight 508. She not only survived a plane crash but survived it falling nearly 3 1/2 Burj Khalifa's (tallest building in the world) without any life-threatening injuries and survived 11 days on her own in the Amazon rainforest. Showing the will to survive, her story shows us how strong, resilient, and determined someone can be when faced with the most difficult challenges."

Sometimes, a family is not what it seems to be. We all have our secrets, and when they're revealed, it can change us completely - and not necessarily in a bad way.  But let’s start from the beginning:Andrew's life was never anything special – his mom and dad were simple people with regular jobs. They never had any big fights, but it wouldn't be true to say that he was close to them either. They didn’t talk much except about ordinary stuff like school, grades and what was for dinner.By the time Andrew's 15th birthday approached, his parents wanted to have a party with all their family friends and their children. Andrew was very annoyed, because he wanted to have fun with his friends. But his parents insisted, so he HAD to accept. During the party, one of the guests, who was a friend of his parents, said: “It’s amazing how much you look like your parents despite your situation.” Andrew was confused, and he immediately asked: “What situation?” “Oh…” the guest said, “...you don’t know…The rest of the party proceeded normally, but for days afterwards Andrew couldn’t stop thinking about what he had meant. One of the things that sprang into his mind was that maybe he had been adopted. It could have been true, because he’d always noticed small differences between his parents and himself. So one day at dinner, Andrew asked the question straight out. His parents just stared at him with a worried look on their faces, not saying anything. And at this moment he realized that he'd found out the truth. And it made him ANGRY. It turned out that EVERYONE knew except him. And it hurt, a lot. Andrew kept asking himself: Who I am? What do I do now? It was a very confusing and scary time for him.He almost started a rebellion. He spent a lot of time outside late at night, and his grades at school went down. The thing he just couldn’t understand was why they refused to talk to him about it. Why did they try to act as though everything was normal? And what was even worse was that they got angry at him when he stayed out for too long, and tried to control him. They weren’t even his real parents, so what right they had to do that?One evening, when he got back late, his father started shouting at Andrew for being spoiled and ungrateful despite everything they did for him. So he turned straight around and left the house. He didn’t know where to go, so he just walked through the dark streets. He doesn’t know how long he walked for, but it felt like hours. Andrew couldn't stop thinking about how nobody really cared about him. His real parents had probably left him, and it seemed that he was nothing more than a nuisance to his adopted ones. He couldn’t go back home, so he went to his favorite childhood place – a pond where he had loved to look at the ducks when he was little. Andrew sat there, cold and sad, and cried. He was completely lost.Suddenly, he saw his parents' car drive up next to the pond. His mother got out of the car. She looked scared and worried. She came up to Andrew and hugged him.  “We were so worried! We didn’t know how to find you, so your father said that we should try looking for you at the pond”. Andrew still couldn't stop crying, and he started asking his mother questions – why did his real parents leave him? Why had they never told him?His mother sighed, then finally started answering his questions: “To be honest, darling, your real parents just didn’t want you. But we do want you. And we love you. Both me and your father. We decided not to tell you, so you would have a normal childhood. But I guess we were wrong. I’m sorry. You are the best thing that ever happened to us.”The only thing Andrew couldn’t understand was why his father was still just sitting in the car and hadn't even come out to talk to him. He looked through the window...and noticed that he was crying as well. Andrew had never seen his father cry. In fact, he rarely saw him showing any emotion. And his tears revealed more than his words could ever say. “Let’s go home,” his mom said. And he did.Andrew realized that his parents weren't perfect –  they didn’t always know how to express their emotions or how to do the right thing. But they did love him. And it didn’t matter if he was adopted or not. They're still his parents, and he loves them despite all their peculiarities. Being loved is one of the best feelings in the world. And he was loved. And for that moment, that was enough for him to be happy again.Music by Epidemic Sound: https://www.epidemicsound.com"

But unlike most teenagers, she spends much of her time living in a hospital as a cystic fibrosis patient. Her life is full of routines, boundaries and self-control -- all of which is put to the test when she meets an impossibly charming fellow CF patient named Will Newman (Cole Sprouse).There’s an instant flirtation, though restrictions dictate that they must maintain a safe distance between them. As their connection intensifies, so does the temptation to throw the rules out the window and embrace that attraction. Further complicating matters is Will’s potentially dangerous rebellion against his ongoing medical treatment. Stella gradually inspires Will to live life to the fullest, but can she ultimately save the person she loves when even a single touch is off limits?#FiveFeetApart // IN THEATERS EVERYWHERE MARCH 22, 2019"

(好きになっちゃうだろう？)’, 마지막화에서 공개된 단체곡 ‘꿈을 꾸는 동안’ , ‘PRODUCE48’의 메인 테마곡 ‘내꺼야’의 ‘IZ*ONE(아이즈원)’ 버전 등이 새롭게 수록 돼 ‘PRODUCE48’부터 아이즈원을 지켜본 이들이라면 새로운 매력을 느낄 수 있다. 데뷔 미니 앨범 ＜COLOR*IZ＞를  시작으로 아이즈원 멤버들이 전 세계를 향해 보여줄 12가지 색깔의 매력을 지켜 보자."

Freddie defied stereotypes and shattered convention to become one of the most beloved entertainers on the planet. The film traces the meteoric rise of the band through their iconic songs and revolutionary sound. They reach unparalleled success, but in an unexpected turn Freddie, surrounded by darker influences, shuns Queen in pursuit of his solo career. Having suffered greatly without the collaboration of Queen, Freddie manages to reunite with his bandmates just in time for Live Aid. While bravely facing a recent AIDS diagnosis, Freddie leads the band in one of the greatest performances in the history of rock music. Queen cements a legacy that continues to inspire outsiders, dreamers and music lovers to this day.Now PlayingCast: Rami Malek, Lucy Boynton, Gwilym Lee, Ben Hardy, Joseph Mazzello, Aidan Gillen, Tom Hollander, Allen Leech and Mike MyersDirected by: Bryan SingerConnect with Bohemian Rhapsody Online:Visit the Bohemian Rhapsody WEBSITE: http://bohemianrhapsody.comLike Bohemian Rhapsody on FACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/BohemianRhapsodyMovieFollow Bohemian Rhapsody on TWITTER: https://twitter.com/BoRhapMovieFollow Bohemian Rhapsody on INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/BohemianRhapsodyMovie#BohemianRhapsodyAbout 20th Century FOX:Official YouTube Channel for 20th Century Fox Movies.

I really have come to appreciate the writing/humor of the show. I think it is so important to be able to not only create a show that is interesting but also keeping it medically accurate and give a great example of how one with autism can strive to new heights. If we can get this video up to 100,000 likes I can use that to try and get Freddie Highmore to do a review with us so smash that like button!!!Anyway, I hope you enjoy this episode of Real Doctor Watches The Good Doctor  / Real Doctor Reacts to The Good Doctor .
