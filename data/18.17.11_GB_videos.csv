He has a problem that maybe you‚Äôve heard about or seen, and which you‚Äôll probably find funny, annoying or creepy. He has Tourette‚Äôs syndrome. He‚Äôs not ashamed of it ‚Äì he‚Äôs got used to it. Pete wants to tell you how he found a way to turn his condition to his advantage rather than accept it was a problem.He was an absolutely normal kid until one morning when he woke up and felt the urge to twitch his head for no reason. And then do it one more time. And again. He was standing in the center of his bedroom doing strange movements, and he couldn‚Äôt control it. Okay, he thought, maybe it‚Äôs some muscular spasm and it will pass. It didn‚Äôt pass even after several days. What was even worse was that he had a couple of other symptoms. Like raising his hands and winking. And the worst thing was that he wanted to squeak like a pig, like this *squeak*, from time to time, and he didn‚Äôt understand why. Of course, all this became pretty noticeable, and he went to see his parents feeling pretty stressed. They took him to the doctor at once, and that‚Äôs where he was diagnosed with Tourette‚Äôs syndrome.Pete had never heard of it before, and he was certain that if he had seen someone else with these symptoms he would have laughed or been disgusted. And now he had to go to school and explain that this was how he would behave for the time being. He was only ten at the time. He still remembers what it felt like standing among his classmates and saying he had a condition, how embarrassing it felt to constantly move, and his classmates laughing at his every single tic. Sure, it certainly looked like he was having fun, but really, it‚Äôs not pleasant or entertaining at all! When he tried to explain that no one actually understood his problem, everyone just thought that it was Pete‚Äôs weird way of expressing himself.And that‚Äôs how he became isolated from everyone. No one wanted to be around him anymore; and the teachers didn‚Äôt even try to give him any support. Even worse, Pete remembers how once his teacher became irritated by his winking ‚Äì she thought he was just making faces, and put him at the back of the room away from everyone else. There he remained, isolated both physically and psychologically. Pete got to know some other guys with Tourette‚Äôs. He thought that he wouldn‚Äôt feel so lonely if he got to know other people with the same problem. Unfortunately, Tourette‚Äôs is tricky, because when you see other people‚Äôs tics, your own tics become worse. And even if a situation like this looks comical in a way, all these tics can be very tiring and debilitating. So Pete came away from these meetings feeling really exhausted, and tried to avoid other Tourette‚Äôs sufferers from then on. In the meantime, the situation with his tics was getting worse ‚Äì more movements appeared, as did more sounds, even abusive language, and in the end he reached his mid-teens looking like a foul-mouthed perpetual motion machine in deep depression.At that time, Pete was browsing a lot on the web, because online no one was disturbed by his tics. One day, he came across a video of a Tourette‚Äôs guy who was singing on ‚ÄúThe Voice‚Äù, and Pete was amazed to see that he performed flawlessly and beautifully, without a single twitch. It was then that he had the idea that maybe he could give it a try himself, and he even knew what he could do. Pete he‚Äôd always been quick-witted and had a good sense of humor, so he thought that he could maybe try a couple of times to do stand-up comedy pieces for a small audience, just to get him out of his house a bit.Pete immediately sat himself down to write punchlines, and the ones he came up with made even him laugh. It was so exciting that he completely forgot his depressed state ‚Äì he was just so drawn into the process. The thing was that his Tourette‚Äôs tics could be pretty amusing if he looked at them from an outsider‚Äôs perspective, and combined with his comic monologue, the effect was hilarious. And what he wanted to tell people was that having his condition was not a stigma; he wasn‚Äôt an idiot or anything, he was just a regular guy.Pete performed his first show surrounded by Tourette‚Äôs patients. The effect was even better than he had expected. He got a standing ovation, which was a bit undeserved in his view, but still pleasant. What‚Äôs more, Pete learned that he really could control his tics better when he was on stage. He went to the local open mic comic club and performed in front of the locals, who first were taken aback by his strange behavior but by the end of the performance were laughing their heads off. And the most important part was that they were laughing not at him, but with him.He‚Äôs now taken his comedy outside the club, and everywhere his audiences like him a lot, while Pete himself feels a lot better ‚Äì more in control and not so lonely anymore.Music by Epidemic Sound: https://www.epidemicsound.com"

Comment, like, share this story.Buddy never really liked his parents, and they never truly got along. They argued and disagreed and butted heads over almost everything. They didn't see eye-to-eye on politics, to religion, to lifestyle and how to raise good healthy happy kids. Buddy is an atheist, while his parents are very devout Muslims. Buddy is very liberal, while his parents are very conservative. And, Buddy is also unapologetically gay, while his parents, not surprisingly, are extremely homophobic. But, even though on the inside it was really clear that he didn't get along with his parents, he was never very public or vocal about his disagreements with his parents.He still needed a roof over his head, and food to eat, and money in his pocket, and he was afraid that if he shared who he really was and what he really believed too strongly they would kick him out of the house, maybe even disown him. Because of that, he formed what looked like a good relationship with his parents, but it was totally fake and artificial - on the inside, he just didn't get along with them. They saw him as being practically perfect, a good and trustworthy kid, but Buddy saw that his parents were really flawed.His mom liked to hold grudges, was very quick to judge people, and liked to enforce really old fashioned gender roles, like boys should do yard work and take out the trash and that girls only belonged in the kitchen and were destined to become subservient housewives. And his father was so invested and distracted by his work that he never formed and real bonds with his children.He was also upset at the way his four sisters were treated. His parents wouldn't allow his sisters to have any friends over. They weren't allowed to have phones, or do any extra curricular activities, or drive once they reached the age where they could legally get their licenses.And it was even worse with Buddy, especially when he tried to come out to them and tell them he was gay - twice. The first time, his parents begged him to date girls because they saw his coming out as a real threat to them. The second time he tried they just threw out a slew of insults and homophobic falsehoods ranging from the idea that gay people were in fact mentally ill, to the idea that it was a simple choice and he was just making the wrong one. They threatened to disown him and told him he would be a failure in life unless he fixed himself.This all made him so unhappy and he imagined that he would be under the control of his parents for the rest of his life. So, he felt he had to continue to pretend to be the perfect little straight Muslim boy in the house, dating girls and praying and the rest. He didn't think much of it, had been doing it pretty much his whole life, but when he finally confided in his friends they saw it for what it was, miserable and very, very unhealthy. They asked him to imagine what he would be and how he would feel if he was far enough away from them that they couldn't watch his every move, and judge and control him.That was a turning point for him and, realizing his parents were more like prison guards than anything else, he thought of the farthest place he could go without them having a negative impact on him and still be successful and thrive as a young gay man.After doing a little bit of research he concluded that California would be the best place for him -- a thriving LGBT community, a ton of diversity and acceptance, and on the other side of the country from his toxic family life and parents. So, he applied to a few schools in California and, was accepted to attend UCLA! It was one of the happiest moments of his life.His parents were hesitant about it at first, because of how far away it was, but they were happy to have him go to such a highly acclaimed school - that's mostly what they cared about.Since moving to Los Angeles Buddy has never been happier. He is part of a really diverse community with amazing friends, endless support, and a great education. Even though he returns home on Holidays and has to pretend, just like he used to, he is so happy to be out of that toxic house and on his own.His next wish is for his sisters, that they will recognize the truth about their parents, follow in his footsteps, and escape!- - -What's your story?  storybooth wants to hear it!

Does the idea of social interaction send panic waves through your body? Yeah, it tends to do that for shy people. But even if you‚Äôve been the quiet type your whole life, there are lots of things you can to do build your confidence, become more charismatic, and get rid of that social awkwardness for good! Do you know that advertising your shyness, you‚Äôre only trapping yourself in this label? People might not even see you as quiet or awkward until you bring it up! And from then on, they‚Äôll only be able to see you that way. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with being ‚Äúthe shy one‚Äù but holding onto that label can really set you back if you sincerely wanna open up and be more conversational. Do you wanna learn more about that? Then watch our new video! Here are 8 tips on how to stop being shy!  TIMESTAMPS: Replace your negative inner voice 0:58Embrace your strengths 1:59Offer information 3:07Don‚Äôt advertise your shyness 4:05Practice your body language 4:56Start saying yes 6:01Stay in the moment 7:02Do the things you‚Äôre scared to do 8:00#shyness #selfconfidence #introvertMusic by Epidemic Sound  https://www.epidemicsound.com/ SUMMARY: - If you have a tough inner voice constantly judging you super harshly and putting you down, then you‚Äôll be more prone to removing yourself from social situations because you expect to be judged by others just as relentlessly.- Shy quiet people are just as smart, successful, competent, and interesting as extroverts. The only difference is that shy people might have a hard time talking about what makes them unique, so others don‚Äôt get a chance to notice it.- Being in a large group of friends or acquaintances can be an awkward experience for people who suffer from social anxiety. But still, don‚Äôt wait for others to ask how you‚Äôre doing, how your projects are going, or what you did this weekend. Take the initiative to tell your friends what‚Äôs going on in your life.- Body language tells you so much about a person. In social situations, people who feel awkward or shy might cross their arms or legs, avoid eye contact, angle their body away from others, stand or sit further away, or lower their head. They might also hide behind their phone or always keep it in hand.- If you‚Äôre shy, you‚Äôre probably skilled at declining invitations just to avoid social interaction. You might even come up with excuses or go out of your way to avoid someone or some event. But when you say ‚Äúno,‚Äù you create a barrier that closes off opportunities.- If you‚Äôre out with a group of friends and you‚Äôve said something incorrectly or you think you sounded foolish, it gets that critical inner voice going and you get so caught up in your self-demeaning thoughts that you totally disengage with what‚Äôs happening at the present time.- Overcoming shyness isn‚Äôt just about learning to talk to people, it‚Äôs also about the basic principle of doing the things you‚Äôre scared to do. You learned earlier that a fear of being judged usually plays a big part in being shy.Subscribe to Bright Side : https://goo.gl/rQTJZz----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Our Social Media:Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/brightside/Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/5-Minute Crafts Youtube: https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuC----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------For more videos and articles visit:http://www.brightside.me/"

She is supported by a huge cast of 59 kids aged 6-11, all dressed as a variety of Christmas staples - including a turkey drummer and set of Christmas lights (plug included). The cast all dance and sing along as the stage transforms to reveal a 40ft Christmas tree and a 14ft glitter-filled gravy boat.The children‚Äôs real parents were featured in the crowd too, and were intentionally kept away from the castings and rehearsals until shoot day.We hope you enjoy seeing our whole cast give all they‚Äôve got for the ones they love.Celebrate Christmas with Sainsbury's!Meet the kids behind the ad: https://youtu.be/F0XGgKStoVw üéµ: The North Star and Friends x Sainsbury‚Äôs - You Get What You GiveListen on Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/album/47EzNPreC2Dciijv8VglnzOriginal song by New Radicals.Shop online: https://www.sainsburys.co.uk/shop/gb/groceries/Christmas"

We started our trip in Lahore, a vibrant, colorful, and packed full of food city. Our first day in Lahore turned out to be a 16 hour street food marathon in Lahore, and it was an amazing day!Get more details on my Pakistan Travel Guide: https://goo.gl/5MHgz4Sadiq Halwa Puri (https://goo.gl/maps/Yoy9dJ6steF2) - We began the day with a very common breakfast throughout Pakistan, halwa puri, but along with chana curry (chickpea curry). We ate off the car, enjoying every bit of the freshly fried puris and curry.Total price - 640 PKR ($4.78)Chacha Feeka Lassi (https://goo.gl/maps/RGQBRQaNj8p) - Next we drove over to Gawalmandi, one of the most legendary areas in Lahore for food. We headed straight to a breakfast staple, the lassi shop and had the most creamy heavy milkshake I‚Äôve ever had, called a pera lassi.Roasted chickpeas - 25 PKR ($0.19) - After exiting an alley, right in front of us was a man selling chickpeas and corn roasted in black Himalayan salt. It‚Äôs a very common street food snack in Pakistan.Sweet potato - 80 PKR ($0.60) - Sweet potato is also a very common street food snack in Lahore, seasoned with masala and a type of citrus juice.Baba Kulfi Wala - Next we headed over to Shah Alami Market, another huge and bustling market in Lahore.Kulfi - 20 PKR ($0.15) each - One of the most famous places to eat ice cream in Lahore is Baba Kulfi Wala, and you‚Äôll find a crowd of people standing around the corner of the road eating sticks of their famous kulfi.Orange juice - 50 PKR ($0.37)Chana chaat - 120 PKR ($0.89) per plate - One of my personal favorite Pakistani street food snacks of the day was chana chaat, a chickpea snack. He added in all sorts of spices, chutneys, and seasonings, to create a deliciously refreshing snack.Butt Karahi Tikka Restaurant - Easily one of the most well known restaurants in Lahore is Butt Karahi, specializing in curry made in a rounded pan, called a karahi (we will be eating a lot of karahi‚Äôs in Pakistan!). We ordered both a mutton karahi and chicken karahi. Both were amazing, filled with spices and butter, but the tenderness of the mutton was the winner.Total price - 5,600 PKR ($41.84)Siddique Fish Corner - You‚Äôll notice that Lahore seems to come alive at night, and street food is everywhere at night. We began the evening with Siddique Fish Corner, one of the best fried fish stalls in Lahore. It was awesome, and so busy.Total price - 400 PKR ($2.99)Khalifa Balochi Sajji - Another Pakistani dish I wanted to try was chicken sajji, a type of hand rotisserie chicken. The atmosphere and cooking method was incredible.Total price - 390 PKR ($2.91)Khan Baba Restaurant - Finally for our last dinner on this 16 hour day of food in Pakistan, we went to one of Ali‚Äôs favorite restaurants in Lahore, Khan Baba. The goat chops were impressive as was the korma curry.Again, massive thank you to Ali, from Pakistan Travel Mart for hosting us in Pakistan, taking us around, and organizing everything.

It has allowed me to make something beautiful for my son -- in his honor.  Early in the process, many of us agreed that Runaway would be a great song to release as a single for COWYS 2.  It is a powerful song that tells the story of how Gus--aka Lil Peep--had decided to leave his apartment in LA, but he didn't want to come home to live in Long Beach, either.  So, he had gone to stay in London.  That was a productive and happy time for him--working with friends like Smokeasac and ILoveMakonnen.This video tells that part of Gus's story.  The story is told using many of Gus's drawings, from different periods of his life.  After transforming into the wonderful flaming-haired character that Gus drew, himself, he flies away from LAX to London--to make music with some of his best friends.I know you will enjoy watching it.  You will see different things each time you watch.  His drawings.  His tattoos.  His friends.  The house where he really lived.  And his dog, Taz, the legend./////Directed by Liza Womack & Steven Mertens (@stevenstmertens)Special Thanks to Smokeasac and ILoveMakonnenAdditional Footage provided by Richard Stilwell/////http://www.lilpeep.party/http://twitter.com/lilpeephttp://instagram.com/lilpeephttp://soundcloud.com/lil_peephttp://facebook.com/lilpeepmusic"

Freddie defied stereotypes and shattered convention to become one of the most beloved entertainers on the planet. The film traces the meteoric rise of the band through their iconic songs and revolutionary sound. They reach unparalleled success, but in an unexpected turn Freddie, surrounded by darker influences, shuns Queen in pursuit of his solo career. Having suffered greatly without the collaboration of Queen, Freddie manages to reunite with his bandmates just in time for Live Aid. While bravely facing a recent AIDS diagnosis, Freddie leads the band in one of the greatest performances in the history of rock music. Queen cements a legacy that continues to inspire outsiders, dreamers and music lovers to this day.Now PlayingCast: Rami Malek, Lucy Boynton, Gwilym Lee, Ben Hardy, Joseph Mazzello, Aidan Gillen, Tom Hollander, Allen Leech and Mike MyersDirected by: Bryan SingerConnect with Bohemian Rhapsody Online:Visit the Bohemian Rhapsody WEBSITE: http://bohemianrhapsody.comLike Bohemian Rhapsody on FACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/BohemianRhapsodyMovieFollow Bohemian Rhapsody on TWITTER: https://twitter.com/BoRhapMovieFollow Bohemian Rhapsody on INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/BohemianRhapsodyMovie#BohemianRhapsodyAbout 20th Century FOX:Official YouTube Channel for 20th Century Fox Movies.
