Comment, like, share this story.Since the day Zoila was born it seemed that her mom never wanted her around. Her whole young life, she was always bouncing from one friend's house to another, and never really having a home until her mom had a new baby - then she was invited to move back in. Being the oldest now, her mom wanted her to take care of her younger brothers. But she was only ten years old - overwhelmed with responsibility, stress, and pressure that not even teens or high school kids should have on them. But, she made it through elementary school and was really excited to go on to middle school, but instead her mom decided to send her to Dominican Republic to stay with her grandparents. She stayed with them until she was 16 years old when her mom finally asked that she return home and that they try to build a good relationship.For the first couple of months everything seemed to be working well. Then, a surprise to everyone, Zoila found out she was pregnant. Her mom was so mad about it that she let it ruin the relationship they were trying to build. Her mom did NOT want to have a new teenage mom around. And, after her baby was born, since she had to stay home and care for her son anyway, her mom made her take care of all her siblings just like when she was ten. It was a lot more complicated this time since she had her own baby to take care of as well.When Zoila finally decided to go back to high school it made the relationship with her mother even harder. She wanted Zoila to stay home all the time to take care of the kids and didn't want her to advance herself with school and education. Zoila refused to drop out and her mom proceeded to kick her and her new baby out of the house.She worked with her high school guidance counselor to try to find a shelter and they finally found the perfect place - Covenant House! It was a perfect solution - and a path for her to graduate. Every day she would wake up early, get ready, and drop her son off at daycare, then a full day of school, followed by an internship, homework, and then repeating the whole thing every single day. She worked so hard.In June, a couple of weeks before graduation, Zoila got a call from her guidance counselor with amazing news! She had been chosen to speak at graduation as valedictorian; graduating with honors. She was so excited, had worked so hard, and felt so proud to have been recognized like that.She had always believed that hard work pays off, as does persistence, determination, overcoming adversity, focus and sticktoitiveness.  But, she had never imagined that she would achieve such an accomplishment. Her graduation speech was all about how even when things get hard, no matter how hard they get, you should never give up. No matter how many obstacles appear in your way, you should always keep striving to achieve your goals.Having her son there to see her give her valedictorian speech - she was the top of the class - really underlined her accomplishment. She felt that not only had she accomplished something powerful for herself, but also something that would be really good for him too.Once she was finished and everyone was cheering and clapping, she saw her son jumping up and down, so excited, and it filled her with pride, hope, love and joy. teen pregnancy story time.- - -SleepOut America: https://sleepoutamerica.org/#stories#MercerCares is honored to support Covenant House and SleepOut America.

First, a portion of the proceeds had to go to charity. Second, I wanted to kidnap Fred Savage. The second condition took some explaining...Fred Savage will join Reynolds in new scenes for ONCE UPON A DEADPOOL in an homage to Savage's starring role in the 1987 bedtime-story classic THE PRINCESS BRIDE. Fred remarked, “while my participation in this film was anything but voluntary, I am happy to learn that Fudge Cancer will be the beneficiary of this shameless cash grab”For every ticket sold, $1 will go to the charity Fudge Cancer - previously known as Fuck Cancer, who have graciously changed their name to be more PG-13 friendly for the 12 days of Once Upon A Deadpool’s release.#OnceUponADeadpoolConnect with Deadpool Online: https://fox.co/OnceUponADeadpoolMovieSiteLike Deadpool on FACEBOOK: http://fox.co/DeadpoolFBFollow Deadpool on TWITTER: http://fox.co/DeadpoolTwitterFollow Deadpool on INSTAGRAM: http://fox.co/DeadpoolInstagram"

She almost certainly doesn’t have the worst problem you’ve heard about here. She still has both her parents, lots of friends, and good health. So what’s the big deal, you might ask? Well, the point is that her family has moved between 10 towns in 3 years, and now she just wants to have a rest!Elaine ought to say a couple of words about her parents. They’re really cool, they’re funny and open-minded, they let her do anything she wants – essentially, they’re more like friends than parents to her. As far as she’s aware, before getting married they lived quite an interesting life, traveling the world as backpackers, living in tents and campers. When her mom got pregnant, they decided to get married and settle down in one place, which seemed like the right decision. Despite their hippie lifestyle, they come from rich families and both have quite a good education, so it wasn’t hard for them to find good jobs.Ironically, Elaine is the complete opposite of her parents. She doesn’t like change, and she doesn’t like to move around a lot. She likes it when her friends and family are by her side, and she enjoys doing the same things every day – it gives her a feeling of safety. Sometimes, her parents laugh and say that she seems to be someone else’s child rather than theirs. Elaine herself sometimes even thinks that she’s a far more serious person than they are, but of course she still loves them a lot and can’t imagine better parents.But there’s one thing that drives her crazy. Three years ago, her mom gave birth to her baby brother, and her dad got a new, better-paid job. The difference was that he had to move a lot from town to town, staying no more than 3-6 months in each place. Mom and dad were of course delighted by this turn of events – they would have the chance to return to their youth and live the nomadic lifestyle they adore the most. But Elaine was terrified. They couldn’t just let dad go off while the rest of the family remained in one place – being separated from your loved ones even for 3 months is too long. So they would have to follow him everywhere he went.Elaine remembers packing her bags, and just crying – she was leaving behind everything that she loved so much – her friends, grandparents, everything. But her mom has always known how to comfort her effectively: “Don’t cry sweetie,. You’ll get to see the whole country, and if you’re lucky even the whole world! Life will be so interesting, and we’ll always be together!” Her mom won her over, and off they went into the world.They were in city #1. Elaine went to a new school; she tried to socialize with new people; found a couple of youth clubs to join and all in all managed to establish a sense of regularity to her life once more. But as soon as she started enjoying it – ta-daaam! They were on the move again. She found herself crying and packing her bags again.Any child would find this lifestyle tough, let alone a home bird like Elaine. First she tried her best to adapt. Then, she was desperate to leave. Then she became passive, and at some point didn’t even bother to talk to people in the latest school she found herself in – they would be temporary friends for her anyway. Naturally, her grades went down. At some point, Elaine fell into a kind of depression, preferring to stay home and not talk to anyone. Funnily enough, her friends list on social media was overflowing while she in reality had no one to talk to. Each new request from her parents to pack the bags now made her obey passively, and there were no longer any tears. Her mom became worried, and asked what was going on.Elaine had been keeping it all inside for far too long. She burst into tears and started shouting that she couldn’t handle being a nomad anymore, that she wanted to go to university but her grades were hopelessly low, that she didn’t have a single close friend to talk to and that generally, she was scared to get close to people because she knew in advance that leaving them would be painful. Her mom looked puzzled. Can you imagine that it didn’t even occur to her parents that she might be unhappy? But for Elaine, it was so freaking obvious.That’s how her parents made the hard decision to send her back to her grandparents to allow her to improve her grades at school, regain her social life, and all in all calm down emotionally. After all, it’s way better this way for everyone, even if she misses them a lot. The only thing she regrets is that she didn’t speak up and express her true feelings earlier, because she lost 3 years to suffering when she could have just talked to her parents and found a compromise.Music by Epidemic Sound: https://www.epidemicsound.com"

But before leaving Lahore, we stopped to eat what is one of the most beloved of all dishes in Pakistan: nihari.Waris Nihari (Read the blog post: https://migrationology.com/nihari-lahore/) - There are a number of famous places to eat nihari when you’re in Lahore, but we tried Waris Nihari, tucked deep within a narrow alley. Nihari is a meat stew, and when you order, he dishes you out some meat, some of the brown stew, and finishes it off with a some desi ghee. They heated up some more desi ghee and poured it on top to complete. The best thing about nihari is that you can season it yourself with chilies, ginger, and lime juice. It’s one of the kings of Pakistani food!Price - 500 PKR ($3.82) per dishGrand Trunk Road - Full from a serious meat breakfast, we continued driving towards Gujranwala taking the famous Grand Trunk Road, what is one of the oldest roads and trade routes in Central Asia.Pakora - After arriving in Gujranwala we stopped to eat some pakoras, a massive display of deep fried snacks. They were dangerously tasty.Camel kebabs - 140 PKR ($1.05) - In the market, while walking around we saw a man selling small camel kebab sliders and we immediately had to taste them. They were incredibly delicious, seasoned with plenty of coriander seeds.Pakistani wrestling with Inam Butt - Wrestling is an ancient sport in Pakistan and we were invited to watch a practice along with world champion wrestler Inam Butt. It was an honor to be there and a lot of fun. Khizar Tikka Shop - For dinner we had a chance to experience of the greatest Pakistani food displays, the gigantic grill at Khizar Tikka Shop in Gujranwala. Their grill and entire kitchen set-up is impressively giant, and their food is incredibly good. I especially enjoyed the small gola kebabs and the goat chops.Sweet paan - For dessert to went to a paan shop and had a sweet paan.Jalebi - And for second dessert we had a huge jalebi.Kulfi - 30 PKR ($0.22) - Finally, last stop of the day, we had a famous kulfi in Gujranwala.It was an amazing day of Pakistani food, lots and lots of meat, and exploring Gujranwala, Pakistan.Thank you to Ali (Pakistan Travel Market) and Saim who arranged and planned our day in Gujranwala.Ali: https://goo.gl/VY6NjHJoel: https://goo.gl/5AkWm6MUSIC: https://us.audionetwork.com/Logo: https://goo.gl/VhaLp5CAMERA GEAR I used to make this video (these are affiliate links):Main camera: http://amzn.to/2sV0XQOMain lens: http://amzn.to/2szLZNf2nd lens: http://amzn.to/2EjBeEgMicrophone: http://amzn.to/2rBKD3zDrone: http://amzn.to/2CrtAHzFOLLOW:Instagram: https://instagram.com/migrationologyFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationologyThank you for watching!"

Does the idea of social interaction send panic waves through your body? Yeah, it tends to do that for shy people. But even if you’ve been the quiet type your whole life, there are lots of things you can to do build your confidence, become more charismatic, and get rid of that social awkwardness for good! Do you know that advertising your shyness, you’re only trapping yourself in this label? People might not even see you as quiet or awkward until you bring it up! And from then on, they’ll only be able to see you that way. There’s nothing wrong with being “the shy one” but holding onto that label can really set you back if you sincerely wanna open up and be more conversational. Do you wanna learn more about that? Then watch our new video! Here are 8 tips on how to stop being shy!  TIMESTAMPS: Replace your negative inner voice 0:58Embrace your strengths 1:59Offer information 3:07Don’t advertise your shyness 4:05Practice your body language 4:56Start saying yes 6:01Stay in the moment 7:02Do the things you’re scared to do 8:00#shyness #selfconfidence #introvertMusic by Epidemic Sound  https://www.epidemicsound.com/ SUMMARY: - If you have a tough inner voice constantly judging you super harshly and putting you down, then you’ll be more prone to removing yourself from social situations because you expect to be judged by others just as relentlessly.- Shy quiet people are just as smart, successful, competent, and interesting as extroverts. The only difference is that shy people might have a hard time talking about what makes them unique, so others don’t get a chance to notice it.- Being in a large group of friends or acquaintances can be an awkward experience for people who suffer from social anxiety. But still, don’t wait for others to ask how you’re doing, how your projects are going, or what you did this weekend. Take the initiative to tell your friends what’s going on in your life.- Body language tells you so much about a person. In social situations, people who feel awkward or shy might cross their arms or legs, avoid eye contact, angle their body away from others, stand or sit further away, or lower their head. They might also hide behind their phone or always keep it in hand.- If you’re shy, you’re probably skilled at declining invitations just to avoid social interaction. You might even come up with excuses or go out of your way to avoid someone or some event. But when you say “no,” you create a barrier that closes off opportunities.- If you’re out with a group of friends and you’ve said something incorrectly or you think you sounded foolish, it gets that critical inner voice going and you get so caught up in your self-demeaning thoughts that you totally disengage with what’s happening at the present time.- Overcoming shyness isn’t just about learning to talk to people, it’s also about the basic principle of doing the things you’re scared to do. You learned earlier that a fear of being judged usually plays a big part in being shy.Subscribe to Bright Side : https://goo.gl/rQTJZz----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Our Social Media:Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/brightside/Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/5-Minute Crafts Youtube: https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuC----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------For more videos and articles visit:http://www.brightside.me/"

The film also showcases a wide array of beloved Pokémon characters, each with its own unique abilities and personality.The story begins when ace private eye Harry Goodman goes mysteriously missing, prompting his 21-year-old son Tim to find out what happened. Aiding in the investigation is Harry’s former Pokémon partner, Detective Pikachu: a hilariously wise-cracking, adorable super-sleuth who is a puzzlement even to himself. Finding that they are uniquely equipped to communicate with one another, Tim and Pikachu join forces on a thrilling adventure to unravel the tangled mystery. Chasing clues together through the neon-lit streets of Ryme City—a sprawling, modern metropolis where humans and Pokémon live side by side in a hyper-realistic live-action world—they encounter a diverse cast of Pokémon characters and uncover a shocking plot that could destroy this peaceful co-existence and threaten the whole Pokémon universe.“POKÉMON Detective Pikachu” also stars Justice Smith (“Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom”) as Tim; Kathryn Newton (“Lady Bird,” TV’s “Big Little Lies”) as Lucy, a junior reporter following her first big story; and Oscar nominee Ken Watanabe (“Godzilla,” “The Last Samurai”) as Lt.

Starring an eight year old star giving the performance of her life, all for her mum. Directed by Michael Gracey, the director of The Greatest Showman. The Show tells the story of the North Star overcoming her nerves to deliver a performance of a lifetime, to the amazement of mum. She is supported by a huge cast of 59 kids aged 6-11, all dressed as a variety of Christmas staples - including a turkey drummer and set of Christmas lights (plug included). The cast all dance and sing along as the stage transforms to reveal a 40ft Christmas tree and a 14ft glitter-filled gravy boat.The children’s real parents were featured in the crowd too, and were intentionally kept away from the castings and rehearsals until shoot day.We hope you enjoy seeing our whole cast give all they’ve got for the ones they love.Celebrate Christmas with Sainsbury's!Meet the kids behind the ad: https://youtu.be/F0XGgKStoVw 🎵: The North Star and Friends x Sainsbury’s - You Get What You GiveListen on Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/album/47EzNPreC2Dciijv8VglnzOriginal song by New Radicals.Shop online: https://www.sainsburys.co.uk/shop/gb/groceries/Christmas"

It has allowed me to make something beautiful for my son -- in his honor.  Early in the process, many of us agreed that Runaway would be a great song to release as a single for COWYS 2.  It is a powerful song that tells the story of how Gus--aka Lil Peep--had decided to leave his apartment in LA, but he didn't want to come home to live in Long Beach, either.  So, he had gone to stay in London.  That was a productive and happy time for him--working with friends like Smokeasac and ILoveMakonnen.This video tells that part of Gus's story.  The story is told using many of Gus's drawings, from different periods of his life.  After transforming into the wonderful flaming-haired character that Gus drew, himself, he flies away from LAX to London--to make music with some of his best friends.I know you will enjoy watching it.  You will see different things each time you watch.  His drawings.  His tattoos.  His friends.  The house where he really lived.  And his dog, Taz, the legend./////Directed by Liza Womack & Steven Mertens (@stevenstmertens)Special Thanks to Smokeasac and ILoveMakonnenAdditional Footage provided by Richard Stilwell/////http://www.lilpeep.party/http://twitter.com/lilpeephttp://instagram.com/lilpeephttp://soundcloud.com/lil_peephttp://facebook.com/lilpeepmusic"

But when events take an unexpected turn, Walter and Lance suddenly have to rely on each other in a whole new way. And if this odd couple can’t learn to work as a team, the whole world is in peril.

(好きになっちゃうだろう？)’, 마지막화에서 공개된 단체곡 ‘꿈을 꾸는 동안’ , ‘PRODUCE48’의 메인 테마곡 ‘내꺼야’의 ‘IZ*ONE(아이즈원)’ 버전 등이 새롭게 수록 돼 ‘PRODUCE48’부터 아이즈원을 지켜본 이들이라면 새로운 매력을 느낄 수 있다. 데뷔 미니 앨범 ＜COLOR*IZ＞를  시작으로 아이즈원 멤버들이 전 세계를 향해 보여줄 12가지 색깔의 매력을 지켜 보자."
