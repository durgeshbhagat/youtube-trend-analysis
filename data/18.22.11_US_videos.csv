He’s arachnophobic, which means that he’s terribly afraid of spiders. Even the word “spider” gives him the creeps if he says it out loud. However, he learned to live with his phobia after one dangerous episode. This is his story.Mike had been afraid of spiders all his life. Some people with the same problem explain that some past scary episode with a spider prompted their phobia, typically when a spider bit them. But this is not what happened with Mike. His phobia is purely irrational; it’s stronger than the usual “fear” many people have – it’s more like a psychological condition. When he sees a spider, he doesn’t scream or jump or run away, nothing like that. Mike just freezes and can’t move a muscle, nor scream, nor even breathe. He just watches the horrible creature move, with eyes full of terror and his heart rate at 250. It’s more than ordinary fear, it resembles paralysis or shock. It’s not pleasant at all.Mike wishes he’d been conditioned to a world full of spiders when he was still a toddler. But maybe his parents were a bit too caring in this case. When he went into a room or sat down somewhere he needed them to check every single surface so that there wasn’t a single spider within a 10-meter vicinity around him. It took time and effort, but his parents were ready to do anything to make him feel comfortable. He sometimes thought that it would have been better if they had told him to just stop being so fearful and get a grip. In this case, maybe the hypothetical spiders he’s now scared of wouldn’t have grown to such gigantic dimensions. Mike can’t blame them, of course – maybe his phobia is innate, who knows. But the thing is, today he still has to check every single inch of a space he’s in. He can’t look at pictures or videos of spiders, even the cutest ones – he comes close to either crying or fainting. All in all, it’s pretty debilitating.What’s worse is that once at school, he involuntarily revealed his secret when he spotted a spider in the vicinity and…well, you know, he’s already explained. The bad thing is that the school bullies saw what happened, and they thought it was really funny that a guy could have problems like that. Once, one of them found a particularly fat spider and threw it at him. Another time they saw a prank video of a small dog dressed as a spider running at strangers and decided to do the same thing. They found a dachshund, dressed it up as a horrible hairy spider, and released it towards him when he least expected it. Of course, they found it funny, whereas Mike came the closest he probably ever would to a heart attack at the age of 14.He spoke about it to his dad, who said that instead of fighting the bullies he should fight his phobia. He said that Mike could try that exposure therapy thing, when they make you get accustomed to the source of your fear by gradually increasing your contact with it: first by seeing pictures of a spider, then watching videos, then looking at a real spider, and then finally holding one in your hands. The idea terrified him, and he refused. But very soon Mike realized that maybe he ought to really consider trying it.At the time, his dad was teaching him to drive. One day, his dad was in the passenger’s seat and Mike was driving at medium speed along a wide, empty road. Everything seemed absolutely safe and nothing could go wrong until…until Mike noticed a huge spider on the wind shield – inside, on his side! He panicked, turned the wheel left, crossing into the opposite lane, and was soon fast approaching a big tree nearby! He doesn’t remember what his dad did, but he managed to stop the car right in front of it. While they were regaining their breath, his dad said in a trembling voice, “Do you still not want to try therapy?” At that moment, he understood that it’s ok when a phobia is someone’s private business, but when you can’t control it, it can be dangerous for others as well. He had to accept his dad’s proposal.Mike started therapy several weeks ago, and it’s going pretty slow. However, he’s already able to look at pictures of spiders and even watch a couple of videos of the cutest ones, like jumping spiders (it sounds horrible but check them out if you’re not scared – they really are the height of cuteness). It’s hard work and very stressful, but his dad has promised him a treat when he completes the full course. Mike’s always dreamed of going to Australia, but...well, you know. A person who’s afraid of spiders should probably stay away from Australia. But his dad said that when he finishes he will take the family there, and that’s turned to be a pretty strong incentive. Besides, Mike can’t wait to see his bullies’ faces when during their next prank they realize he’s not scared of spiders anymore!Music by Epidemic Sound: https://www.epidemicsound.com"

Comment, like, share this story.Since the day Zoila was born it seemed that her mom never wanted her around. Her whole young life, she was always bouncing from one friend's house to another, and never really having a home until her mom had a new baby - then she was invited to move back in. Being the oldest now, her mom wanted her to take care of her younger brothers. But she was only ten years old - overwhelmed with responsibility, stress, and pressure that not even teens or high school kids should have on them. But, she made it through elementary school and was really excited to go on to middle school, but instead her mom decided to send her to Dominican Republic to stay with her grandparents. She stayed with them until she was 16 years old when her mom finally asked that she return home and that they try to build a good relationship.For the first couple of months everything seemed to be working well. Then, a surprise to everyone, Zoila found out she was pregnant. Her mom was so mad about it that she let it ruin the relationship they were trying to build. Her mom did NOT want to have a new teenage mom around. And, after her baby was born, since she had to stay home and care for her son anyway, her mom made her take care of all her siblings just like when she was ten. It was a lot more complicated this time since she had her own baby to take care of as well.When Zoila finally decided to go back to high school it made the relationship with her mother even harder. She wanted Zoila to stay home all the time to take care of the kids and didn't want her to advance herself with school and education. Zoila refused to drop out and her mom proceeded to kick her and her new baby out of the house.She worked with her high school guidance counselor to try to find a shelter and they finally found the perfect place - Covenant House! It was a perfect solution - and a path for her to graduate. Every day she would wake up early, get ready, and drop her son off at daycare, then a full day of school, followed by an internship, homework, and then repeating the whole thing every single day. She worked so hard.In June, a couple of weeks before graduation, Zoila got a call from her guidance counselor with amazing news! She had been chosen to speak at graduation as valedictorian; graduating with honors. She was so excited, had worked so hard, and felt so proud to have been recognized like that.She had always believed that hard work pays off, as does persistence, determination, overcoming adversity, focus and sticktoitiveness.  But, she had never imagined that she would achieve such an accomplishment. Her graduation speech was all about how even when things get hard, no matter how hard they get, you should never give up. No matter how many obstacles appear in your way, you should always keep striving to achieve your goals.Having her son there to see her give her valedictorian speech - she was the top of the class - really underlined her accomplishment. She felt that not only had she accomplished something powerful for herself, but also something that would be really good for him too.Once she was finished and everyone was cheering and clapping, she saw her son jumping up and down, so excited, and it filled her with pride, hope, love and joy. teen pregnancy story time.- - -SleepOut America: https://sleepoutamerica.org/#stories#MercerCares is honored to support Covenant House and SleepOut America.

Fox has been asking for a PG-13 basically since the start in 2006, Ryan Reynolds told Deadline. I've said no since 2006. Now, this one time, I said 'Yes' on two conditions. First, a portion of the proceeds had to go to charity. Second, I wanted to kidnap Fred Savage. The second condition took some explaining...Fred Savage will join Reynolds in new scenes for ONCE UPON A DEADPOOL in an homage to Savage's starring role in the 1987 bedtime-story classic THE PRINCESS BRIDE. Fred remarked, “while my participation in this film was anything but voluntary, I am happy to learn that Fudge Cancer will be the beneficiary of this shameless cash grab”For every ticket sold, $1 will go to the charity Fudge Cancer - previously known as Fuck Cancer, who have graciously changed their name to be more PG-13 friendly for the 12 days of Once Upon A Deadpool’s release.#OnceUponADeadpoolConnect with Deadpool Online: https://fox.co/OnceUponADeadpoolMovieSiteLike Deadpool on FACEBOOK: http://fox.co/DeadpoolFBFollow Deadpool on TWITTER: http://fox.co/DeadpoolTwitterFollow Deadpool on INSTAGRAM: http://fox.co/DeadpoolInstagram"

A new trailer, images and poster are now available. The trailer features Colin Farrell, Michael Keaton, Danny DeVito, Eva Green, Finley Hobbins and Nico Parker.Circus owner Max Medici (Danny DeVito) enlists former star Holt Farrier (Colin Farrell) and his children Milly (Nico Parker) and Joe (Finley Hobbins) to care for a newborn elephant whose oversized ears make him a laughingstock in an already struggling circus.

Vandevere (Michael Keaton), who recruits the peculiar pachyderm for his newest, larger-than-life entertainment venture, Dreamland.

Gus liked shooting in the basement, and in the garage. He liked playing with atmosphere.  In this one, he was playing with light and shadow.  He was also very proud of his new glasses.  He needed prescription glasses, and this was the only pair he ever had with a prescription in them. ///// Directed by MezzyAnimation by Bryson MichaelShot by Will SilberfeldProduced by Smokeasac & IIVI ///// http://www.lilpeep.party/ http://twitter.com/lilpeep http://instagram.com/lilpeep http://soundcloud.com/lil_peep http://facebook.com/lilpeepmusic"

Spending 11 days in the Amazon rainforest, at 17 years old, she had to remain mentally strong gathering all of her strength and her will to survive. A true story, Juliane only had 1 shoe and 1 eye to see out of. Being separated from the entire plane wreckage, she knew she had to find her way out if she wanted to survive. The thick Amazon rainforest made it difficult for rescues to find the plane, let alone her! She tried so desperately to find her mother, but in her fragile state, she had to worry about herself first. Not knowing if she would ever be found, she took a chance and followed a river hoping it would be her shot at finding people. Her gamble paid off when she managed to find a resting post where the next day, people found her and quickly transported her to a hospital. Out of 91 passengers, she is the only survivor of the Lansa Flight 508. She not only survived a plane crash but survived it falling nearly 3 1/2 Burj Khalifa's (tallest building in the world) without any life-threatening injuries and survived 11 days on her own in the Amazon rainforest. Showing the will to survive, her story shows us how strong, resilient, and determined someone can be when faced with the most difficult challenges."

But unlike most teenagers, she spends much of her time living in a hospital as a cystic fibrosis patient. Her life is full of routines, boundaries and self-control -- all of which is put to the test when she meets an impossibly charming fellow CF patient named Will Newman (Cole Sprouse).There’s an instant flirtation, though restrictions dictate that they must maintain a safe distance between them. As their connection intensifies, so does the temptation to throw the rules out the window and embrace that attraction. Further complicating matters is Will’s potentially dangerous rebellion against his ongoing medical treatment. Stella gradually inspires Will to live life to the fullest, but can she ultimately save the person she loves when even a single touch is off limits?#FiveFeetApart // IN THEATERS EVERYWHERE MARCH 22, 2019"

But when events take an unexpected turn, Walter and Lance suddenly have to rely on each other in a whole new way. And if this odd couple can’t learn to work as a team, the whole world is in peril.
