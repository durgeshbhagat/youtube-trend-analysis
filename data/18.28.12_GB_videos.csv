In this episode of Vox Almanac, Phil Edwards explores the history and controversy behind the style.Known as tonsure, the typical monk hairstyle has many variations throughout religions. The particular hairstyle worn by Christian monks has its own variations and controversies as well.  Three different types of tonsure were popular: a coronal tonsure, a Pauline tonsure, and a third Celtic tonsure that came to represent the differences between the Roman Catholic and Celtic Catholic church.The winding path of this tonsure is a new way to look at the division within the religion and the unpredictable ways something like hair can represent faith.Support our work and get a peek behind the scenes at Vox by joining the Vox Video Lab, our members community on YouTube.

On the contrary, she was a regular girl with a normal amount of friends. All of them were great people who didn’t care about popularity, focusing instead on their hobbies and studies. Some people thought they were weirdos and made mean comments, although her friends didn’t care. But Lily did. When they were eating lunch, she would always look at the popular girls’ table. You know the kind – they’re all very fashionable and beautiful, and walk around at school like they own the place. Everyone wants to be their friend, and nobody wants to be their enemy.She desperately wanted to be in their group – to get all the attention from the boys and be invited to all the parties. But it would never happen, or so she thought. Luckily, one of them, Emma, sat next to her in art class. Lily was pretty good at drawing, and Emma noticed and said “wow, can you draw me?” Lily said “sure”, and drew her the best she could. She even made her look a bit better that she did in real life, and she was like, “wow, that’s so cool!” She was happy but didn’t think much of it.The next day she was passing by their table, and Emma called her over and invited her to sit with them. Lily was so surprised and happy! She sat with them and they gave her so many compliments, like saying that she was so different yet she looked so good, she had her own style. They were so nice, constantly complimenting each other – she just couldn’t imagine these girls arguing. Her friends looked over from their table and texted her that she should be careful with those girls, that they’re weren’t as nice as they seemed. At the time she thought that they were just jealous.So she started hanging out with them, and at first it was great – they helped her choose her clothing to look more fashionable (or more precisely, like them), and she was generally considered a new member of their group. Lily now looked different, behaved different, and most importantly, felt different. There were immediate results – people were more willing to talk and be friends with her, boys showed much more interest in her than before, and her subscriber count on social media rose very quickly!But soon Lily noticed that some things were not quite right. First, she realized that her position in the group was...weird. She was a new girl, so they didn’t treat her like an equal. Compliments soon turned into mean jokes, and she really disliked it, but she kept hanging out with them, because she liked being popular.Secondly, she soon noticed how they always gossiped about other people. It was always like, “OMG have you seen how fat that girl is?” or “haha does this guy ever wash?” And all she could do was just laugh with them, no matter how weird it was for her. And if someone from the group was absent, they would say bad stuff about them. By that time she was miserable, and hated every second she spent with them, but she felt like she couldn’t just walk away. Her friends didn’t bother talking to her, and to be honest, she didn’t try either.The popular girls were fake, and all the attention they received was fake too – like if a boy texted her or tried to talk with her, it was only because she was with the popular girls; they didn’t care about who she really was. By that time there were one or two new girls in the group, and she noticed that it was the same with them as it had been with her – compliments at first, and then...well, you know already.One day, when they were having lunch as usual, one of her old friends passed by, and the girls at her table started to giggle and say mean stuff about her – like, that her hair looked bad, and she was such a loser, and blah blah blah. They were even looking directly at her and laughing, and her friend just pretended she didn’t notice it. Lily couldn’t take it anymore, so she said “don’t make fun of her, she’s a really great person and she’s my friend! In fact, all the people at that table are great if you get to know them!” Emma answered “oh yeah? Then go sit with them, then!”All the other girls laughed at that, and she wanted to say something in response, but instead just kept silent. She was staring at her tray, and then suddenly thought “well, why don’t I, really?” So she stood up, and without saying a word, sat back at her real friends’ table. They were surprised and she said sorry at least a thousand times. They understood and accepted her back, and she was even happier than when the popular girls had accepted her.It was funny to look at their faces when she passed by them in school. They tried to make fun of her, but she was happy and they couldn’t change that – and they were MAD about it.Everyone, don’t chase popularity – it’s really not worth it.Music by Epidemic Sound: https://www.epidemicsound.com"

Haunted by an unexplainable and unresolved trauma from her past and compounded by a string of eerie coincidences, Adelaide feels her paranoia elevate to high-alert as she grows increasingly certain that something bad is going to befall her family.After spending a tense beach day with their friends, the Tylers (Emmy winner Elisabeth Moss, Tim Heidecker, Cali Sheldon, Noelle Sheldon), Adelaide and her family return to their vacation home. When darkness falls, the Wilsons discover the silhouette of four figures holding hands as they stand in the driveway. Us pits an endearing American family against a terrifying and uncanny opponent: doppelgängers of themselves. Writer and director Peele produces for his Monkeypaw Productions alongside Sean McKittrick, Jason Blum, and Monkeypaw’s Ian Cooper. Us will be released by Universal Pictures on Friday, March 15, 2019."

Comment, like, share this story.You all know who Lilly Singh is, right? How could you not? She's an actress, a comedian, a huge YouTube star, and a social media celebrity of the highest degree! She also has a huge heart and believes in empowering young woman (and everybody for that matter) to be their best most powerful selves. Lilly Singh is amazing, and we're sure she always has been BUT before she was famous she was just a kid doing all those things kids do - hanging out with friends and family (she has lots of cousins), playing video games, and finding ways not to be bored, like watching horror movies and telling each other scary stories, and playing with each others imaginations.When she was younger all of her cousins would go to her house to hang out with her and her sister. The parents would all head off to work and the kids would all look after each other - immigranthustle. One day, just after their parents left, they were all piled onto the couch playing video games when the phone rang. Her older cousin answered it, said hello a few times, but nobody was there. Weird, but maybe just a wrong number, or at worst a crank call.Lilly and her cousins got back to their video game, and had played for a little while when the phone rang again. This time another cousin answered and the same thing happened, nobody was on the other end, or at least they weren't saying anything. It was a little scary, what kind of evil demon of a person would do that to a bunch of kids?At that point Lilly and her cousins could have come up with some good rational reasons for the phone calls - like a wrong number, a bad connection, a telemarketer, etc. BUT that's not what a bunch of kids home alone do, so instead they came up with a whole story about how some evil demon or person was trying to get to them and do bad things!They decided they needed a master plan, a way to make sure their story didn't turn out to be a scary horror story. Now, keep in mind, this was right around Christmas and they had just finished doing a Home Alone marathon.They began by documenting all of the calls that came in and capturing  every detail. This would help them come up with their plan for scaring away the evil demon, or whatever - the evil telemarketer. On day three they received more calls than usual and they felt it was definitely a sign. They brainstormed their plan.Was it a robber? A spirit? A demon? The possibilities were endless. Their planning was interrupted when one of their cousins stopped them as said hey, didn't you guys hear that? Now, Lilly hadn't heard anything, but what was the fun of that, and, if there was some demonic Christmas Home Alone presence there with them, she didn't want to be the first to go just because she didn't believe it was real. She wasn't going to be THAT kid in the horror movie. Or one of those ghost stories. It was time to take action. They all gathered up all the utensils from the kitchen drawers and then executed their plan : lock themselves in their parents bedroom and wait it out. But before they locked themselves  in the room they strategically placed three little porcelain pigs in the hallway that could warn them if something trampled that way.Hours went by with them locked in the bedroom, pacing, sweating, stressing and terrified. But, eventually their need for Oreos overcame them so they ventured into the kitchen and felt so relieved, and silly for acting so scared and ridiculous. UNTIL they noticed that one of the little pigs had been knocked over.They freaked out, and around the house, and then finally decided it was time to take a stand - it was either them, or the demon! They searched the entire house with their forks and butter knives ready. But of course, they found nothing.A couple of hours later her parents returned home and all their cousins left. End of story, right? Well, they never felt anymore evil presences, and the phone stopped ringing, but, you never know.

Please see my comments below with regards to reports the video was partially faked.  Go to https://NordVPN.com/MarkRober and use code MARKROBER to get 75% off a 3 year plan and an extra month for free.My buddy Sean posted a video with more details of the build: https://youtu.be/IpMxOmUcfOINote about 2 missing the reactions in the video- I was presented with information that caused me to doubt the veracity of 2 of the 5 reactions in the video.  These were reactions that were captured during a two week period while the device was at house 2 hours away from where I live.  I put a feeler out for people willing to put a package on their porch and this person (who is a friend of a friend) volunteered to help.  To compensate them for their time and willingness to risk putting a package on their porch I offered financial compensation for any successful recoveries of the package.  It appears (and I've since confirmed) in these two cases, the “thieves were actually acquaintances of the person helping me.  From the footage I received from the phones which intentionally only record at specific times, this wasn’t clear to me. I have since removed those reactions from the original video (originally 6:26-7:59).  I’m really sorry about this.  Ultimately, I am responsible for the content that goes on my channel and I should have done more here.  I can vouch for that the reactions were genuine when the package was taken from my house.  Having said that,  I know my credibly is sort of shot but I encourage you to look at the types of videos I’ve been making for the past 7 years.  This is my first ever video with some kind of “prank and like I mentioned in the video it’s pretty removed from my comfort zone and I should have done more.  I’m especially gutted because so much thought, time, money and effort went into building the device and I hope this doesn’t just taint the entire effort as “fake.  It genuinely works (like all the other things I’ve built on my channel) and we’ve made all the code and build info public.  Again, I’m sorry for putting something up on my channel that was misleading.  That is totally on me and I will take all necessary steps to make sure it won’t happen again.High Speed camera courtesy of https://www.aimed-research.com/.

Mr Corbyn pulled a screeching U-turn to move his motion two hours after appearing to abandon it while claiming the threat alone had been enough to make the PM name a new date for the 'meaningful vote' on her Brexit deal. The bizarre sequence of events began at around 3pm when Mr Corbyn's said he would call for a vote if Mrs May did not reschedule the Brexit showdown she postponed last week. Mr Corbyn did not issue his motion when he spoke at 3.45pm - and Labour launched a social media blitz claiming the threat alone had been enough to get a date. Downing Street said it had made no difference and pointed out Mrs May said last week the vote would be held in the New Year and before January 21. Despite claiming victory, Mr Corbyn returned to the Commons at 5.50pm to table his motion anyway.Original Article: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6504533/Corbyn-set-demand-stunt-vote-no-confidence-Theresa-May.htmlOriginal Video: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/video/news/video-1826182/Video-WALKS-House-Commons-Corbyn-calls-vote-no-confidence.htmlDaily Mail Facebook: http://facebook.com/dailymailDaily Mail IG: http://instagram.com/dailymailDaily Mail Snap: https://www.snapchat.com/discover/Daily-Mail/8392137033Daily Mail Twitter: http://twitter.com/MailOnlineDaily Mail Pinterest: http://pinterest.co.uk/dailymailDaily Mail Google+: https://plus.google.com/+DailyMailGet the free Daily Mail mobile app: http://dailymail.co.uk/mobile"

What software do you use?A. Simon's Cat has been made using a variety of animation software over the years. Originally in Adobe Flash. Then TV Paint (and still on occasions) and most recently using CelAction.Q. Why does it take so long to make each Simon's Cat film?A. Animation is a slow process and Simon’s Cat films pay particular attention to observed, real life cat behaviour. Historically the films were traditionally animated frame by frame. More recently we use CelAction which has sped up the process but still requires a lot of care and attention. Each film takes approximately 6-9 weeks to make, depending on complexity, number of characters and special effects.#HappyHolidays #SnowballFight"

The furnace burns the fuel on a grate for maximum area of air entry. The chimney attached to the furnace is 2 m tall above ground level. The pit is 25 cm cubed and extends below ground level. The whole structure took about 2 weeks to build.A brick of iron oxide (from iron bacteria) mixed with charcoal powder was made and placed in the furnace sitting on a grate about 12.5 cm tall. The furnace was lit with wood and fired. Charcoal was added after this point and a high temperature was reached. The ore brick melted and produced some tiny beads of cast iron.In contrast to the other furnace I made in the previous video, this one produced less iron while consuming the same amount of charcoal. I’d actually built this furnace before the previous video in an attempt to reduce labour by having a tall draft chimney replace the work and complexity involved with using a blower. I’ll keep experimenting with natural draft furnaces, the principle is sound but the method of introducing the ore (batches of ore on a grate instead of continuous addition of ore pellets) is probably inefficient or could be improved on.About Primitive Technology:Primitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. These are the strict rules: If you want a fire, use a fire stick - An axe, pick up a stone and shape it - A hut, build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without utilizing modern technology. I do not live in the wild, but enjoy building shelter, tools, and more, only utilizing natural materials.

For Samurai's to stay healthy and fit they ate a lot of vegetables, and I thought it was pretty good although I don't really eat veggies. And to end my fun food day, I went to grab some Okonomu-Yaki.

Fox has been asking for a PG-13 basically since the start in 2006, Ryan Reynolds told Deadline. I've said no since 2006. Now, this one time, I said 'Yes' on two conditions. First, a portion of the proceeds had to go to charity. Second, I wanted to kidnap Fred Savage. The second condition took some explaining...Fred Savage will join Reynolds in new scenes for ONCE UPON A DEADPOOL in an homage to Savage's starring role in the 1987 bedtime-story classic THE PRINCESS BRIDE. Fred remarked, “while my participation in this film was anything but voluntary, I am happy to learn that Fudge Cancer will be the beneficiary of this shameless cash grab”For every ticket sold, $1 will go to the charity Fudge Cancer - previously known as Fuck Cancer, who have graciously changed their name to be more PG-13 friendly for the 12 days of Once Upon A Deadpool’s release.#OnceUponADeadpoolConnect with Deadpool Online: https://fox.co/OnceUponADeadpoolMovieSiteLike Deadpool on FACEBOOK: http://fox.co/DeadpoolFBFollow Deadpool on TWITTER: http://fox.co/DeadpoolTwitterFollow Deadpool on INSTAGRAM: http://fox.co/DeadpoolInstagram"
