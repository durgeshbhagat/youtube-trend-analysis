The furnace burns the fuel on a grate for maximum area of air entry. The chimney attached to the furnace is 2 m tall above ground level. The pit is 25 cm cubed and extends below ground level. The whole structure took about 2 weeks to build.A brick of iron oxide (from iron bacteria) mixed with charcoal powder was made and placed in the furnace sitting on a grate about 12.5 cm tall. The furnace was lit with wood and fired. Charcoal was added after this point and a high temperature was reached. The ore brick melted and produced some tiny beads of cast iron.In contrast to the other furnace I made in the previous video, this one produced less iron while consuming the same amount of charcoal. I‚Äôd actually built this furnace before the previous video in an attempt to reduce labour by having a tall draft chimney replace the work and complexity involved with using a blower. I‚Äôll keep experimenting with natural draft furnaces, the principle is sound but the method of introducing the ore (batches of ore on a grate instead of continuous addition of ore pellets) is probably inefficient or could be improved on.About Primitive Technology:Primitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. These are the strict rules: If you want a fire, use a fire stick - An axe, pick up a stone and shape it - A hut, build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without utilizing modern technology. I do not live in the wild, but enjoy building shelter, tools, and more, only utilizing natural materials.

Ok, what‚Äôs the big deal? Everyone knows a person or two with diabetes. It‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs something really exotic ‚Äì everyone knows what diabetes is. Or do they? If you think about it a little more, however, you‚Äôll realize that apart from avoiding eating too much sugar, you probably don‚Äôt really know that much about diabetes. This is the story of Lil‚Äôs life, and it will help you find out a bit more.She was an absolutely typical kid. And as often happens, everything went fine until one morning...She fell down the stairs while she was in a hurry for the school bus. She sprained her ankle, and instead of taking her to school her scared parents took her to the hospital. While they were on their way, she explained to them that she‚Äôd fallen because her vision had gone blurry, and it was still like that in the car. She was also extremely thirsty. This alarmed her parents at once. So the doctor examined her with two complaints in mind. He had two bits of news for her ‚Äì the good one and the bad one. The good news was that her ankle would be ok in no time. The bad news was that her blood sugar was sky high, and after several analyses she was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes ‚Äì an incurable condition.What did it mean? To Lil at that time, it was just an odd-sounding word. But the doctor explained it to her very vividly. Imagine you‚Äôre in the middle of a seesaw. The seesaw‚Äôs board is your blood sugar level. In order to keep stable you need to maintain your balance, but it will never be stable on its own ‚Äì it will go up and down, up and down, and you need to do a lot of work to keep it more or less balanced. And if it goes too far up or too far down, you‚Äôll fall down. And end up in the hospital. Otherwise‚Ä¶otherwise you‚Äôll fall down and go to the hospital. Or something much worse.This was a shock more to her parents than to her. Lil‚Äôs mom was totally lost, not knowing what to do, where to start‚Ä¶But she herself was actually cool; you know, even with the seesaw metaphor it was still very abstract. It was only later that she realized how limiting diabetes could be. She received a brand new glucose meter and she had to check her blood 6-7 times a day. She had to check the numbers she saw there and take the necessary action, which was either an insulin injection if it was too high, or eating candy, drinking a glass of juice or consuming something else that was sweet if it was too low.What effects did it have on her life? First, it was embarrassing. She had a specialized kit that she had to carry with her, and she had to take it out wherever she was and carry out strange procedures in order to check her sugar levels. Secondly, the whole thing was disappointing. She loved eating candy, and the idea that from now on she would have to take strict control of her diet was heartbreaking. You have to calculate carbohydrates and evaluate every tiny lollipop you dare to eat. She remembers every time someone in her family took a cookie, she came up asking, ‚ÄúCan I have one as well?‚Äù She already knew what the response would be, but she still hoped that maybe THAT time she could.And last, but not least, it was scary. When you start along your path as a diabetic, you just don‚Äôt realize that something dangerous is happening. So you‚Äôre not too obsessive about it. Not until the day when you have a low-sugar crisis, called a hypo, and you find yourself absolutely disoriented, like a zombie, trying to eat anything you can reach. Or when you forget your kit at home and go to the hospital because you‚Äôve missed your shot and your sugar levels are skyrocketing.This is the reason why, unfortunately, Lil‚Äôs teen years were not the best ones you can imagine. She was always slightly depressed, because first of all, she had to grow up real quick and develop a sense of responsibility she wasn‚Äôt eager to have. Imagine you‚Äôre 10 years old and you need to give yourself a shot, and your life depends on it. Lots of other diabetic people have this problem ‚Äì from one crisis to another you realize that you‚Äôre irresponsible, because you don‚Äôt control it well enough. It‚Äôs such a stressful situation to see those numbers going up and down and back up again all day long. Even if any doctor would tell you that you‚Äôre not irresponsible, you‚Äôre still diabetic, and everyone has the same struggle.However there‚Äôs always a silver lining to every cloud! First of all, being cautious about your health brings only benefits. Secondly, your ability to adapt grows considerably. Now she‚Äôs studying hard, because her ambition is to become a biochemistry scientist some time in the future. That‚Äôs why she says that diabetes is not a fun condition to have, but even so it can make you a better, more responsible and more determined person.Music by Epidemic Sound: https://www.epidemicsound.com"

Comment, like, share this story.Bella lives in a neighborhood called Squirrel Hill in Pittsburgh. She's grown up there, lived there her whole life, has her friends and her synagogue there, right near the Tree of Life synagogue, and it had always been a peaceful neighborhood - diverse and accepting - a really nice place to live. There were a lot of Jewish families who lived there and she could hardly remember any anti semitism ever happening around them.But, on Saturday, October 27th, she slept in late and only woke up when her mom called to her from the other room at around eleven o'clock. She ran in to her Mom's room and her younger sister was there and they looked awful, pale, afraid and scared. Bella didn't know what was going on, and her mom would only whisper because she didn't want Bella's youngest sister to wake up. But something really, really bad was going on - you could tell from the terrified looks on her Mom and sister.Her mom asked is she'd looked at her phone yet, if she'd seen or heard any of what was on the news. She'd heard lots of sirens in her half sleep, but they didn't wake her - what was going on? Her mom sat her down and told her that there had been a mass shooting at a temple - the Tree of Life synagogue right there in squirrel hill. Bella gasped and sat down hard. She was so scared, afraid, shaking and crying. She was just in shock that something like this had happened, in their neighborhood, at a synagogue that was practically right next to the one she attended. Also, the fact that it was all because of their religion, all because they were Jewish, and this scared Bella too - the ant-semitism, and all these shootings taking place everywhere.What made the tragedy even worse was the fact that it was Shabbat, the holiest day of the week for the Jewish people -- all they were doing was praying -- and that morning the Tree of Life synagogue was having a baby naming for a new baby just born into their community, a special and festive and happy occasion. And an evil man full of hate and anti semitism came into their place of worship and shot and killed 11 people, including police and security guards.When Bella and her friends returned to their religious school, hebrew school, so many of them were on edge, scared, and couldn't quite put into words how awful and vulnerable it made them feel. Why was there anti semitism, or hate of any kind? Why couldn't people coexist without hatred and gun violence?After they had started their school day they had a special morning prayer service and they invited the congregation from the Tree of Life synagogue to join them. There were so many people there, mourning and praying, holding hands and supporting each other - praying for peace, and love, and for the souls of the those who passed to ascend. And they chanted and sang words of power, that they were strong and that they would not be afraid.The Pittsburgh synagogue shooting has effected jews all over the United States and the world, and all people who enjoy feeling safe and free to worship how they choose under any religion they choose. Hopefully the families affected by this tragedy will be able to feel one day that those they lost did not die in vain and that they re-awakened the need for peace, and love, and light across the entire world._____What's your story?  storybooth wants to hear it!  actually happenedLINKS:Website: http://www.storybooth.comInstagram: @thestorybooth twitter @thestorybooth https://www.instagram.com/thestoryboothG+: https://plus.google.com/+StoryboothFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/thestorybooth/Tumblr: https://storybooth.tumblr.com/If you liked this storybooth animation and love storytime / story time story booth kid videos, watch our themed playlist collections:Being Yourself: https://goo.gl/89enENLove and Heartbreak: https://goo.gl/mfaoKwEmbarrassing and Funny: https://goo.gl/5GjxrWBullies and Mean People:https://goo.gl/THS3LBOvercoming Challenges: https://goo.gl/pbxRa9"

I combined the two days because things didn‚Äôt work out as planned on Day 9, and so didn‚Äôt end up being able to film much. But that‚Äôs the way things go sometimes!So firstly, on Day 9, the plan was to drive from Shigar to to Deosai National Park, and drive all the way through the park to the other side, en-route to Gilgit. Unfortunately it started snowing along the way, and by the time we arrived to the entrance of the park, it was snowing too hard, and it was too risky to proceed. So we turned around and took the long way to Gilgit.Gilgit, Gilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan - Ok, so now back to today (Day 10) we started the morning with a street food tour of Gilgit. Gilgit is an amazing small town, sort of the gateway of Gilgit Baltistan, and a commerce hub for the region on the Karakoram highway. The town is extremely friendly, and everywhere we went to eat on this small market and street food tour, we were greeted with such friendliness and hospitality.Kabuli pulao - 140 PKR ($1.04)Grilled meat - 120 PKR ($0.89)Curry - 120 PKR ($0.89)After about an hour eating street food and walking around the market, we continued on to Nizam‚Äôs house, which was about a 15 minute drive from the center of Gilgit. Nizam is an employee of Ali, and he graciously invited us to his amazing home in the countryside. The view from the backyard was breathtaking.We first went to the river valley to pick vegetables where we met Nizam‚Äôs father in law, who again may be the happiest man on earth - he was amazing pounding the chilies. We picked vegetables, and just stood in amazement at the natural wonder beauty of Pakistan. Lunch was incredibly delicious, all the fresh vegetables we picked, plus both mutton and beef curry, with rice and roti. The curries were some of the best I ate in Pakistan, but the fresh mountain vegetables, sauteed down with dried tomato, were the highlight. An incredible meal, really one of the most memorable I had in my entire trip to Pakistan.Thank you Nizam and family for the amazing meal!Watch the entire Pakistani video series: https://youtu.be/Xdya8eym9nMAli: https://goo.gl/VY6NjHJoel: https://goo.gl/5AkWm6MUSIC: https://us.audionetwork.com/Logo: https://goo.gl/VhaLp5CAMERA GEAR I used to make this video (these are affiliate links):Main camera: http://amzn.to/2sV0XQOMain lens: http://amzn.to/2szLZNf2nd lens: http://amzn.to/2EjBeEgMicrophone: http://amzn.to/2rBKD3zDrone: http://amzn.to/2CrtAHzFOLLOW:Instagram: @migrationologyFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationologyThank you for watching!"

Fox has been asking for a PG-13 basically since the start in 2006, Ryan Reynolds told Deadline. I've said no since 2006. Now, this one time, I said 'Yes' on two conditions. First, a portion of the proceeds had to go to charity. Second, I wanted to kidnap Fred Savage. The second condition took some explaining...Fred Savage will join Reynolds in new scenes for ONCE UPON A DEADPOOL in an homage to Savage's starring role in the 1987 bedtime-story classic THE PRINCESS BRIDE. Fred remarked, ‚Äúwhile my participation in this film was anything but voluntary, I am happy to learn that Fudge Cancer will be the beneficiary of this shameless cash grab‚ÄùFor every ticket sold, $1 will go to the charity Fudge Cancer - previously known as Fuck Cancer, who have graciously changed their name to be more PG-13 friendly for the 12 days of Once Upon A Deadpool‚Äôs release.#OnceUponADeadpoolConnect with Deadpool Online: https://fox.co/OnceUponADeadpoolMovieSiteLike Deadpool on FACEBOOK: http://fox.co/DeadpoolFBFollow Deadpool on TWITTER: http://fox.co/DeadpoolTwitterFollow Deadpool on INSTAGRAM: http://fox.co/DeadpoolInstagram"

She used spy gadgets and a hidden camera tracker device to sneak into the top secret laboratory. While inside they found mysterious clues about code 10 and the GM Network on his laptop. Rebecca Zamolo went home and reacted to the Game Master‚Äôs new video taking down Project Zorgo and tried to solve the mystery if they are working together. In today‚Äôs video Rebecca uses a treasure map inside the tunnel that leads her to an abandoned swimming pool where she finds a key hidden in the water. Matt and Rebecca hide behind a rock to spy on a secret meeting between the GameMaster and Pumpkin Patch along with two other mystery men ninjas. Using spy gadgets we heard mysterious code words then watched them each receive a final mystery note. Matt began secretly chasing Pumpkin Patch while I followed the Game Master into a new hidden cave. I believe if we can uncover PP‚Äôs disguise and do a face reveal he can help us solve this puzzle and keep us safe.
