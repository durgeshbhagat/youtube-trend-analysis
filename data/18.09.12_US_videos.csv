Today is a highly requested video! I've been building this huge collection of panda bun squishies (thanks to you guys) and it was definitely time to give some of them makeovers!!This is a squishy makeover video, but it's a different format than usual because there are 8 makeovers instead of the typical 3-4. So, these are 8 ways to decorate a panda bun!These are also simpler designs than my usual, but I thought maybe this could be helpful for beginners or anyone who is interested in trying out squishy decorating. Panda buns are a great way to start out since they are so cheap, easy to find and such a simple shape!Here's where you can find some of your own panda buns (AFFILIATE):https://amzn.to/2PsIFxDWATCH THE WHOLE MAKEOVER SERIES: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...Wanna see unedited squishy makeovers, behind the scenes footage, biweekly video updates and get access to exclusive polls and q&as?CHECK OUT MY NEW PATREON: https://www.patreon.com/moriahelizabeth________ Materials List__________http://www.moriah.video/materials.html_________FAQs__________1. CAN I SEND YOU SQUISHIES?So many generous people have sent me their unwanted squishies so I actually have a lot to work on already. BUT if you have squishies that you really don't want anymore, email me at fanmail@moriah.video to request my P.O. box address :).2. ARE SQUISHIES RETURNED TO THE SENDERS AFTER THE MAKEOVER?No. Everyone gave me these squishies as donations to the series because they were no longer wanted. Everyone has been informed in advance that squishies would not be returned. It would be completely impossible for me financially to send back squishies. Just to RECEIVE these squishies costs me hundreds of dollars (I have to pay for P.O. box fees) There are MANY other reasons as well, I explained it in this video if you want to know the full list of reasons: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKYCV...3. WHAT PAINT DO YOU USE?I use fabric paint. Fabric paint is meant to stretch, so it is perfect for squishing! Any brand will work fine, but I mainly use Tulip and Scribbles. You can find it at Michaels, Hobby Lobby, A.C. Moore, Walmart, Joann Fabrics, and Online.4. IS PUFFY PAINT THE SAME AS FABRIC PAINT?Yep!! Puffy paint is just a type of fabric paint.5. WILL FABRIC PAINT CRACK?The matte fabric paint is more likely to crack after lots of squishing. Slick fabric paints never crack. But there are benefits to both. I usually mix the two paints together to get the best of both worlds.6. CAN I USE ACRYLIC PAINT ON SQUISHIES?I would not recommend that. Acrylic paint will either make the squishy hard, or it will crack and flake off. 7. WHAT MEMORY FOAM DO YOU USE?I usually just buy a memory foam pillow on Amazon.com and use that to cut up.8. CAN YOU DO MORE SQUISHIES IN EACH VIDEO OR DO MAKEOVER VIDEOS EVERY WEEK?I wish I could! But these videos take me about 30-50 hours to film and edit (not including waiting for the paint to dry or any breaks). And usually about 8 or 9 days of working on it. So it‚Äôs not really possible to do these any more than I am already doing without lowering the quality. PLUS! I want to keep up with my Monday videos and my art and craft videos as well ‚ò∫9. WHY DO YOU SOMETIMES USE A POPSICLE STICK AND OTHER TIMES USE A PAINTBRUSH TO APPLY PAINT?The ‚Äúslick‚Äù fabric paint has a very thick consistency that does not spread easily with a paint brush. Using a popsicle stick is much easier for this type of paint. BUT the matte fabric paint is much thinner, similar consistency to acrylic paint and it can easily be applied with a paintbrush. When you mix the two, you can get away with a paintbrush as well :)10. WHY DO YOU LIKE RAINBOW SO MUCH?I just like color, and I think rainbows are pretty. There‚Äôs really no other reason for my obsession hahaPURCHASE ME PRODUCTSCREATE THIS BOOK:https://amzn.to/2vUerfICREATE THIS BOOK 2:https://amzn.to/2Nx2G9fME MERCH:https://teespring.com/stores/moriah-elizabethGET TO KNOW MEBECOME A PATRON (GET ACCESS TO EXCLUSIVE CONTENT):https://www.patreon.com/moriahelizabethVISIT ME WEBSITE:http://www.moriah.video/INSTAGRAM: instagram.com/moriahelizabethofficialCONTACT MEEMAIL PICTURES OF YOUR ART:Artwork@Moriah.videoFOR BUSINESS INQUIRIES ONLY:Business@Moriah.video_MAIL ME_For sending squishies, Letters, or general fan mail, please contact: FANMAIL@MORIAH.VIDEO to request my P.O. box address :)MUSIC CREDITS:Intro Music by: SHIFTYPOPMusic: Love Light and Twinkles by JivingGerbil (link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwaUO...)Chee Zee Jungle - Primal Drive by Kevin MacLeod is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)Source: http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1100684Artist: http://incompetech.com/"

My novelty cakes come in all shapes and sizes - giant versions of foods, gross stuff like brains, movie characters and some of my favorite things! Basically, I love to build stuff out of cake, buttercream, fondant, candy, cookies and anything sweet! This ‚Äúcake‚Äù started off as 8 batches of the original Rice Krispies¬Æ treat recipe, packed into pans to hold their shape. I stacked them up with royal icing, and lined them with strips of fondant for decoration. I then molded some towers out of more Rice Krispies¬Æ treats, and added fondant windows and doors. To finish it off, I laid out a beautiful sprinkle rooftop terrace and made a cute sprinkle garden around it! Voila, this toy castle is complete! I wish I could move in...Got an idea for a cake?

Actually, her name is Josephine, but you wouldn‚Äôt be able to imagine a person less suitable to be called Josephine. She‚Äôs a tomboy, and she‚Äôs proud of it. However, life as a tomboy is not as amusing as you might imagine. She‚Äôs faced a lot of problems, and she wants to tell you about them.Jo had trouble communicating with other girls right from her early childhood. She remembers one time when a large group of children had gathered in one place for a party or something, and her mom gently pushed her towards the other girls and said, ‚Äúgo play with the dolls, make friends with someone!‚Äù She diligently started moving dolls here and there and listening to boring talk about girly problems, but all the while she kept looking at the boys, who were playing something thrilling, laughing and doing their boyish stuff. She was so envious that at some point she just silently stood up and joined them. That was the moment when the fun started for her.Things didn‚Äôt improve as the years went by. Jo was always attracted to the world of boys, and all of her friends were boys as well. She felt at ease when she talked to them, and felt that she understood their problems and their way of thinking better. Whereas when she was around girls, she was totally clueless. Their problems were hard for her to follow, especially when they complained about boys.Jo had to adapt her looks to her lifestyle as well. When she went out with her friends, they always did something active, like skateboarding or exploring abandoned buildings or climbing trees. For these kinds of things, you need to dress in a practical way. She found out that jeans and hoodies are much more comfortable in this respect than typical girls‚Äô clothes, which she had always hated in any case. And that is how she has dressed her whole life. For Jo, it was always a tragedy when they made some formal visit and she needed to dress ‚Äúproperly‚Äù, as people would call it. A cute dress, shiny shoes, a neat hairdo‚Ä¶ ugh. As you can probably imagine, phrases like ‚Äúwear skirts, be more feminine, you‚Äôre a girl‚Äù were the things she kept hearing time and again, until at one point her parents just gave up.It wasn‚Äôt that Jo felt she was ugly or anything, and that being a tomboy was her way of gaining confidence. She actually thinks she‚Äôs quite cute, and when she‚Äôs forced to be a girly girl she looks no worse than her peers. For her, being a tomboy is a lifestyle, and she‚Äôs happy with that. The problem was that some time ago, she‚Äôd noticed that her friends had started dating.One of the things that people were often mistaken about was the belief that because Jo was a tomboy, she must be gay. But she‚Äôs actually attracted to boys, not girls. Ironically, she actually gets a lot of backtalking from girls who say that she‚Äôs just trying to get attention from all the boys around her. She‚Äôs never taken this seriously, because she‚Äôs never had THAT kind of attention from the boys. Which is actually the core of her problem.Yes, she‚Äôs seeking her first romance. She has lots of boys around her. So what‚Äôs the problem, you might ask. The problem is that they don‚Äôt really see her as a girl! They know she‚Äôs a girl, of course, but they don‚Äôt want to date her, because who would date a bro? Once, there was a boy she liked, and she thought it would be wise to approach him and ask if he wanted to go out with her. And guess what ‚Äì he just laughed at her! He wasn‚Äôt mean or anything, it was more something like ‚ÄúSorry bro, I don‚Äôt see you as a GIRL‚Äù. Seeing the look on her face, he corrected himself: ‚ÄúI mean, THAT kind of a girl‚Äù. Oh thanks, now that‚Äôs much better!This was the first time when being a tomboy had a negative effect on her life. She even tried to put on make up and a dress, but felt really weird and the boys just looked at her strange as well. She gave up and lost hope. It seemed like it was a price that she had to pay to keep the comfortable and amusing life of a tomboy. She became a bit melancholic looking at all those happy couples, and felt that something was missing from her life for the first time.One day she was invited out to go skateboarding, but she wasn‚Äôt in the mood so she just sat there, watching her friends and thinking her sad thoughts. One of her oldest friends soon came over to sit with her and asked why she was so sad. She didn‚Äôt want to lie, so she explained everything as it really was ‚Äì that no one wanted to date her because no one considered her a potential girlfriend. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt cry‚Äù, he said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll go on a date with you!‚Äù She refused out self-respect. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need charity‚Äù, she said. Suddenly, he became very serious and said that he really wanted to. And so she accepted. Accidentally, she had made the same mistake all her friends had made with her ‚Äì she hadn‚Äôt considered his feelings, because you don‚Äôt go on dates with buddies. Well, she was mistaken.

Over the course of five studio records, two Christmas releases, and a fan favorite live album, they have impressively tallied 2 billion-plus global streams, clocked upwards of 1.6 billion YouTube views, earned six No. 1 debuts on the Billboard Top Classical Albums Chart, sold out concerts in almost every corner of the world, averaged nearly 2 million monthly listeners on Spotify, and attracted a diehard audience. Not to mention, they‚Äôve appeared in The New York Times, Fast Company, BuzzFeed, Mashable, and People, were featured on CBS Sunday Morning and performed on the TODAY Show, Good Morning America and The Tonight Show. Their latest album, Limitless catapulted to the top of the charts, holding the No. 1 spot on iTunes, Apple Music and Amazon classical charts.  With over 28 million digital streams worldwide, the newest release from The Piano Guys lives up to the name Limitless as the foursome once again leap past boundaries for the 13-track collection.  Limitless features the guys‚Äô take on the latest pop hits ‚Äì from Shawn Mendes to Ed Sheeran to Coldplay and The Chainsmokers, The Piano Guys continue to break new ground, even exploring the K-Pop world with two BTS covers.  Rounding out the collection are two tracks from the box office hit The Greatest Showman as well as four new original compositions, culminating in a diverse new album with massive multigenerational appeal.

Comment, like, share this story.Since the day Zoila was born it seemed that her mom never wanted her around. Her whole young life, she was always bouncing from one friend's house to another, and never really having a home until her mom had a new baby - then she was invited to move back in. Being the oldest now, her mom wanted her to take care of her younger brothers. But she was only ten years old - overwhelmed with responsibility, stress, and pressure that not even teens or high school kids should have on them. But, she made it through elementary school and was really excited to go on to middle school, but instead her mom decided to send her to Dominican Republic to stay with her grandparents. She stayed with them until she was 16 years old when her mom finally asked that she return home and that they try to build a good relationship.For the first couple of months everything seemed to be working well. Then, a surprise to everyone, Zoila found out she was pregnant. Her mom was so mad about it that she let it ruin the relationship they were trying to build. Her mom did NOT want to have a new teenage mom around. And, after her baby was born, since she had to stay home and care for her son anyway, her mom made her take care of all her siblings just like when she was ten. It was a lot more complicated this time since she had her own baby to take care of as well.When Zoila finally decided to go back to high school it made the relationship with her mother even harder. She wanted Zoila to stay home all the time to take care of the kids and didn't want her to advance herself with school and education. Zoila refused to drop out and her mom proceeded to kick her and her new baby out of the house.She worked with her high school guidance counselor to try to find a shelter and they finally found the perfect place - Covenant House! It was a perfect solution - and a path for her to graduate. Every day she would wake up early, get ready, and drop her son off at daycare, then a full day of school, followed by an internship, homework, and then repeating the whole thing every single day. She worked so hard.In June, a couple of weeks before graduation, Zoila got a call from her guidance counselor with amazing news! She had been chosen to speak at graduation as valedictorian; graduating with honors. She was so excited, had worked so hard, and felt so proud to have been recognized like that.She had always believed that hard work pays off, as does persistence, determination, overcoming adversity, focus and sticktoitiveness.  But, she had never imagined that she would achieve such an accomplishment. Her graduation speech was all about how even when things get hard, no matter how hard they get, you should never give up. No matter how many obstacles appear in your way, you should always keep striving to achieve your goals.Having her son there to see her give her valedictorian speech - she was the top of the class - really underlined her accomplishment. She felt that not only had she accomplished something powerful for herself, but also something that would be really good for him too.Once she was finished and everyone was cheering and clapping, she saw her son jumping up and down, so excited, and it filled her with pride, hope, love and joy. teen pregnancy story time.- - -SleepOut America: https://sleepoutamerica.org/#stories#MercerCares is honored to support Covenant House and SleepOut America.

First, a portion of the proceeds had to go to charity. Second, I wanted to kidnap Fred Savage. The second condition took some explaining...Fred Savage will join Reynolds in new scenes for ONCE UPON A DEADPOOL in an homage to Savage's starring role in the 1987 bedtime-story classic THE PRINCESS BRIDE. Fred remarked, ‚Äúwhile my participation in this film was anything but voluntary, I am happy to learn that Fudge Cancer will be the beneficiary of this shameless cash grab‚ÄùFor every ticket sold, $1 will go to the charity Fudge Cancer - previously known as Fuck Cancer, who have graciously changed their name to be more PG-13 friendly for the 12 days of Once Upon A Deadpool‚Äôs release.#OnceUponADeadpoolConnect with Deadpool Online: https://fox.co/OnceUponADeadpoolMovieSiteLike Deadpool on FACEBOOK: http://fox.co/DeadpoolFBFollow Deadpool on TWITTER: http://fox.co/DeadpoolTwitterFollow Deadpool on INSTAGRAM: http://fox.co/DeadpoolInstagram"
