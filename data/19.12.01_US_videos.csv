His natural gravitation towards music lead to him to hip-hop; he began recording his fledgling verses on his cell phone. He quickly gained traction online, racking up millions of views on YouTube.Fittingly, he titled his 2018 mixtape 'Life B4 Fame' with the hopes that things would change for the better once his career really took off. He was right—within two days, his mixtape had amassed more than one million streams on MyMixtapez. Things will only go up from there, and if the snippets from his forthcoming Rich Homie Quando project are any sign, he’s only only getting better with time."

Ranging from Grammy Award winners to legendary athletes, and everything in between, the singers may attempt to throw the crowd off of their scent, while keen observers might pick up on tiny clues buried throughout the show. One singer will be eliminated each week, ultimately revealing his or her true identity. It’s not a “whodunit,” it’s a “whosungit!”The Pineapple Is Revealed | Season 1 Ep. 2 | THE MASKED SINGERhttps://www.youtube.com/c/MaskedSingerFOX#TheMaskedSinger"

Comment, like, share this story.Hannah and her family were on vacation in the countryside. They'd rented a little cottage on a farm. They loved all the farm animals, and the dogs and cats, and the great outdoors - fresh air. They had no idea they were about to come face-to-face with the worst kind of animal abuse and mistreatment. Real animal cruelty.On their last day they decided to take a hike around the farm and the woods around them. After walking for a little while they stumbled upon a huge, beautiful open field. Here mom, the nature lover, insisted that they walk through it.As they started hiking through the huge field they started seeing all these seemingly abandoned cars everywhere - minivans - parked randomly all over the field, and each one with dark windows and locked up with a padlock.When they walked up to one to peer inside the windows, what they saw was very, very disturbing. Each van was filled with animals, in cages, and it seemed that they had been really badly abused, neglected, and mistreated.They went from one rusted out old van to another, and inside each one were more abused animals - kittens and cats, puppies and dogs, birds and other small pets and animals. It got more and more suspicious and strange the further into the field they went. There must have been hundreds of abused animals, all in serious need of rescue.As they approached the other end of the field they came to a small fenced off area, a broken down paddock. In the middle of this tiny space was a horse, in just horrible condition. It was so underfed and uncared for - malnourished - that its ribs were sticking out and it was so thin you could count them. The poor horse was tied up to a stake, and the bridle had been rubbing against his nose and face - hurting him.It was absolutely horrifying. At that point her mom and dad had seen enough - they were really upset and concerned. How could no one have done anything about these poor neglected pets and animals, innocent dogs and cats and birds and horses? It was time to get out of there and do something to rescue these abused animals. Maybe they would call the police. Maybe Animal Rescue or a shelter, the ASPCA or RSPCA, but no matter what, it was illegal, a crime.When they got back to their cottage they went straight to the owner. She told them that the man who owns that other land had been in trouble, even arrested for abusing and neglecting animals before, and that he had been watching them the whole time they were on their hike.They immediately called the police and animal rescue and they came right away and took the horse and other animals. When Hannah saw some of the cats and dogs coming out of their cages, it broke her heart - some of them couldn't even walk. There were so many of them, so sick and neglected.It was sad, but Hannah was so happy that they had taken that walk and found those abused animals and made sure that they were rescued. And she wants everyone to know how awful it is to see these poor animals up close, and that if you do abuse animals and get caught, you will go to jail. And, if you see animals that appear to be neglected or abused, tell someone or call the police and make sure they get rescued! You might really be saving them._____What's your story?  storybooth wants to hear it!LINKS:Website: http://www.storybooth.comInstagram: @thestorybooth twitter @thestorybooth https://www.instagram.com/thestoryboothG+: https://plus.google.com/+StoryboothFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/thestorybooth/Tumblr: https://storybooth.tumblr.com/If you liked this storybooth animation and love storytime / story time story booth kid videos, watch our themed playlist collections:Being Yourself: https://goo.gl/89enENLove and Heartbreak: https://goo.gl/mfaoKwEmbarrassing and Funny: https://goo.gl/5GjxrWBullies and Mean People:https://goo.gl/THS3LBOvercoming Challenges: https://goo.gl/pbxRa9#storybooth #storyboothOnlyTrueStories"

TFIL has been around for 2.5 years traveling the world with the goal to conquer 1,000 things I want to do before I do (The f**k if list) & now the channel is changing to become a non-profit VICE style documentary channel.    Apologies for the opening 35 seconds, we’re just weird dudes that do whatever we want.  Keep the homophobic comments out of here.  TFIL IS NOT ENDING.  READ THIS! Lots of fun stuff happening that you can be involved in!The travel-first-person-vlog style is ending though.Over the next 30 days TFIL is going to be progressing into what will be the first ever NON-PROFIT Youtube channel.  Every video made will be to benefit various non-profits around the world to help bring exposure, awareness and of course, donations to their cause. We will be donating 100% of the ad-sense from the videos to their respective charities.  These videos will have a slight touch of the old-school TFIL vlog style but heavily intertwined with what you see in a standard documentary.  (20 minutes long each, approximately) That will start approximately mid March.   Until then! Feb 3rd I will start the next 24/7 charity live-stream that will benefit the TREVOR Project & National Suicide Prevention Hotline. Goal is to raise $150,000.  I will be locked in a freezer.  Yes, a freezer. Feb 11th - I'm releasing the music video with Simple Plan & Scotty Sire.The next 3 weekends, I will be releasing a different WORLD RECORD video. End of January!  We are shooting these videos in LA!  We will need at least 500 people to join to help us break these records!! Please stay tuned to my Twitter @EltonCastee for full details coming soon.

Mounting evidence has shown that cash bail unfairly affects low-income minorities who don’t have the money to pay for release before their trial. As a result, defendants languish in jail while waiting for court dates. While in jail, many of them lose their jobs, housing, and parental rights, all of which can weaken their community network, erode domestic relationships, and cost the government money to keep them in jail. Defenders of cash bail claim it is an effective mechanism for keeping violent criminals in jail. Despite their efforts to protect the status quo, several states have pursued bail reform. These states model their new systems on a pretrial risk assessment system. Risk assessments use algorithms to analyze data about a defendant and make recommendations for their pretrial release. The District of Columbia has used risk assessments since the early 1990s with success. But many reform activists are concerned that when cash bail is replaced with risk assessments, courts are using another unjust — and potentially more biased — pretrial release mechanism.

We all like shopping, right? You know – those moments when you feel down and say to yourself: “Why don’t I just go to the mall and buy everything I want?” And then you come home with numerous bags containing things you actually don’t need, but you have a strange feeling of relief? Well, Denise can tell you that sometimes this seemingly innocent habit can become obsessive, and even dangerous.She was in high school when her life suddenly turned into hell. Everything was going perfect – a loving family, nice friends, a wonderful boyfriend. When everything is going fine, at some point you start suspecting that it can’t last forever. And indeed, during her sophomore year, things started crumbling. Her parents had a huge argument and didn’t talk to each other. She even heard some conversations about a divorce. Denise became nervous because of these family problems, and couldn’t concentrate on her studies. Her grades went down.Unfortunately, for the first time in her life, Denise had a nervous breakdown, and had no idea how to handle it. The worst thing was that she had no one to confide in – her parents had their own problems to deal with, and she had neither a best friend nor a boyfriend anymore. She didn’t want to bother people who weren’t very close to her, and she didn’t want to get too personal with them either. She had only one choice left to her – to deal with her problems on her own. Denise found her very own way to decrease her stress levels, which was…shopping!She remembers once how her parents had a particularly heated argument, and she escaped from the house just to be on her own in silence for a while. “Where can I go?” she thought. Of course, the mall! Lots of people, crowded shops, food court. A perfect place to hide from your thoughts. It would also be nice to buy herself a couple of new outfits as a distraction from her depressed mood. So that’s what she did, and she really did forget about her problems completely while she was trying on new jeans and choosing herself a new handbag.She had some money saved, and she had the opportunity to go shopping at least once a week. She was quickly becoming an addict – at some point she began to want to buy more things, more often. She was doing it not because she needed anything, but because she wanted those positive emotions she felt when shopping. After a couple of months, Denise realized that she was quickly running out of money, as well as space in her room to keep all the things she was buying. But it didn’t bother her at all! So, she could dedicate herself to her “hobby” completely.Actually, storage space objectively wasn’t a big problem – she didn’t even wear what she bought, so she just stored new things wherever she could. Money was a bigger problem – she spent all the money she had, and the weekly allowance from her parents wasn’t enough. She came up with an ingenious solution – she started taking cash straight from her mom’s bag. She certainly wasn’t proud of herself, but she convinced herself that it was not stealing and that her mom wouldn’t mind anyway. Of course, it was stealing and now she feels ashamed about it! But at that moment she couldn’t help it – she so needed money for her addiction.But then one day she decided that she needed to GO BIG. She took her dad’s credit card. What was she thinking?! Her idea was that if she spent just a little bit he wouldn’t notice. But unfortunately she didn’t manage to moderate her desires. She spent a huge sum of money, around 500 bucks, and returned the card to his wallet all scared and trembling about what he would do to her when he found out. But a day passed, then three, then five, and he seemed to have not noticed a thing. And she was dying to make another raid around the shops, so she thought, why don’t I do it just one more time?That time she just couldn’t stop, she spent and spent and spent without even trying anything on, just buying whatever she could see. Until at some point she heard that phrase that everyone dreads: “Sorry, your card was declined”. Obviously, that was the signal to stop shopping. Of course, she became worried, because why on earth would a credit card be blocked? She got her answer at home when she was greeted by her dad, who was absolutely furious. He had been called by the bank and told that there had been numerous suspicious purchases on his card, and then he noticed that his credit card was missing. Denise decided not to invent any stories, and just told him the truth.Well, at that point her mom and dad finally united to punish her, and it was the turning point when they finally made peace. She got the attention she longed for, and after that particular shock, she didn’t even feel the urge to go shopping anymore. Now she’s obsessed with keeping fit. Well...At least it doesn’t cost money!Music by Epidemic Sound: https://www.epidemicsound.com"

Haunted by an unexplainable and unresolved trauma from her past and compounded by a string of eerie coincidences, Adelaide feels her paranoia elevate to high-alert as she grows increasingly certain that something bad is going to befall her family.After spending a tense beach day with their friends, the Tylers (Emmy winner Elisabeth Moss, Tim Heidecker, Cali Sheldon, Noelle Sheldon), Adelaide and her family return to their vacation home. When darkness falls, the Wilsons discover the silhouette of four figures holding hands as they stand in the driveway. Us pits an endearing American family against a terrifying and uncanny opponent: doppelgängers of themselves. Writer and director Peele produces for his Monkeypaw Productions alongside Sean McKittrick, Jason Blum, and Monkeypaw’s Ian Cooper.

Even at 5:30 am when we arrived it was vibrant and busy, and action packed. It was a good start to the day, because especially when I eat seafood, I love to visit the fish market and get a sense of the seafood available before eating it. We also stopped at the fisherman canteen for a quick local Pakistani Karachi breakfast of paratha and chai.We drove out to the beach house, about an hour from the center of Karachi, along the Arabian sea. Already, the seafood feast was underway. There’s was both a full grill section of seafood, and a full curry section.Everything was delicious, but the highlight were the crab lollipops, mostly crab claws and arms, which were tossed in a beautiful curry sauce. It was spectacular.And this seafood meal was the perfect way to end an amazing trip to Pakistan!-----End of Pakistan video series:For 16 Days the People of Pakistan greeted us with respect and hospitality, allowed me to film, invited us into their homes, and many, even refused to let us to pay for food we ate... and the list goes on. Thank you to the People of Pakistani for your amazing hospitality and welcome.

The Doom Patrol's members each suffered horrible accidents that gave them superhuman abilities — but also left them scarred and disfigured. Traumatized and downtrodden, the team found purpose through The Chief, who brought them together to investigate the weirdest phenomena in existence — and to protect Earth from what they find. Part support group, part Super Hero team, the Doom Patrol is a band of super-powered freaks who fight for a world that wants nothing to do with them. Picking up after the events of TITANS, DOOM PATROL will find these reluctant heroes in a place they never expected to be, called to action by none other than Cyborg, who comes to them with a mission hard to refuse, but with a warning that is hard to ignore: their lives will never, ever be the same.Based on DC characters originally written and drawn by Arnold Drake, Bob Haney and Bruno Premiani#DCUDOOMPATROL premieres February 15.

Please see my comments below with regards to reports the video was partially faked.  Go to https://NordVPN.com/MarkRober and use code MARKROBER to get 75% off a 3 year plan and an extra month for free.My buddy Sean posted a video with more details of the build: https://youtu.be/IpMxOmUcfOINote about 2 missing the reactions in the video (I posted this on all my social channels immediately after it happened)- I was presented with information that caused me to doubt the veracity of 2 of the 5 reactions in the video.  These were reactions that were captured during a two week period while the device was at house 2 hours away from where I live.  I put a feeler out for people willing to put a package on their porch and this person (who is a friend of a friend) volunteered to help.  To compensate them for their time and willingness to risk putting a package on their porch I offered financial compensation for any successful recoveries of the package.  It appears (and I've since confirmed) in these two cases, the “thieves were actually acquaintances of the person helping me.  From the footage I received from the phones which intentionally only record at specific times, this wasn’t clear to me. I have since removed those reactions from the original video (originally 6:26-7:59).  I’m really sorry about this.  Ultimately, I am responsible for the content that goes on my channel and I should have done more here.  I can vouch for that the reactions were genuine when the package was taken from my house.  Having said that, I know my credibility is damaged but I encourage you to look at the types of videos I’ve been making for the past 7 years.  This is my first ever video with some kind of “prank and like I mentioned in the video, it’s pretty removed from my comfort zone and I should have done more.  I’m especially gutted because so much thought, time, money and effort went into building the device and I hope this doesn’t just taint the entire effort as “fake.  It genuinely works (like all the other things I’ve built on my channel) and we’ve made all the code and build info public.  Again, I’m sorry for putting something up on my channel that was misleading.  That is totally on me and I will take all necessary steps to make sure it won’t happen again.High Speed camera courtesy of https://www.aimed-research.com/.
