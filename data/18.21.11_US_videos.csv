Comment, like, share this story.Since the day Zoila was born it seemed that her mom never wanted her around. Her whole young life, she was always bouncing from one friend's house to another, and never really having a home until her mom had a new baby - then she was invited to move back in. Being the oldest now, her mom wanted her to take care of her younger brothers. But she was only ten years old - overwhelmed with responsibility, stress, and pressure that not even teens or high school kids should have on them. But, she made it through elementary school and was really excited to go on to middle school, but instead her mom decided to send her to Dominican Republic to stay with her grandparents. She stayed with them until she was 16 years old when her mom finally asked that she return home and that they try to build a good relationship.For the first couple of months everything seemed to be working well. Then, a surprise to everyone, Zoila found out she was pregnant. Her mom was so mad about it that she let it ruin the relationship they were trying to build. Her mom did NOT want to have a new teenage mom around. And, after her baby was born, since she had to stay home and care for her son anyway, her mom made her take care of all her siblings just like when she was ten. It was a lot more complicated this time since she had her own baby to take care of as well.When Zoila finally decided to go back to high school it made the relationship with her mother even harder. She wanted Zoila to stay home all the time to take care of the kids and didn't want her to advance herself with school and education. Zoila refused to drop out and her mom proceeded to kick her and her new baby out of the house.She worked with her high school guidance counselor to try to find a shelter and they finally found the perfect place - Covenant House! It was a perfect solution - and a path for her to graduate. Every day she would wake up early, get ready, and drop her son off at daycare, then a full day of school, followed by an internship, homework, and then repeating the whole thing every single day. She worked so hard.In June, a couple of weeks before graduation, Zoila got a call from her guidance counselor with amazing news! She had been chosen to speak at graduation as valedictorian; graduating with honors. She was so excited, had worked so hard, and felt so proud to have been recognized like that.She had always believed that hard work pays off, as does persistence, determination, overcoming adversity, focus and sticktoitiveness.  But, she had never imagined that she would achieve such an accomplishment. Her graduation speech was all about how even when things get hard, no matter how hard they get, you should never give up. No matter how many obstacles appear in your way, you should always keep striving to achieve your goals.Having her son there to see her give her valedictorian speech - she was the top of the class - really underlined her accomplishment. She felt that not only had she accomplished something powerful for herself, but also something that would be really good for him too.Once she was finished and everyone was cheering and clapping, she saw her son jumping up and down, so excited, and it filled her with pride, hope, love and joy. teen pregnancy story time.- - -SleepOut America: https://sleepoutamerica.org/#stories#MercerCares is honored to support Covenant House and SleepOut America.

She almost certainly doesn‚Äôt have the worst problem you‚Äôve heard about here. She still has both her parents, lots of friends, and good health. So what‚Äôs the big deal, you might ask? Well, the point is that her family has moved between 10 towns in 3 years, and now she just wants to have a rest!Elaine ought to say a couple of words about her parents. They‚Äôre really cool, they‚Äôre funny and open-minded, they let her do anything she wants ‚Äì essentially, they‚Äôre more like friends than parents to her. As far as she‚Äôs aware, before getting married they lived quite an interesting life, traveling the world as backpackers, living in tents and campers. When her mom got pregnant, they decided to get married and settle down in one place, which seemed like the right decision. Despite their hippie lifestyle, they come from rich families and both have quite a good education, so it wasn‚Äôt hard for them to find good jobs.Ironically, Elaine is the complete opposite of her parents. She doesn‚Äôt like change, and she doesn‚Äôt like to move around a lot. She likes it when her friends and family are by her side, and she enjoys doing the same things every day ‚Äì it gives her a feeling of safety. Sometimes, her parents laugh and say that she seems to be someone else‚Äôs child rather than theirs. Elaine herself sometimes even thinks that she‚Äôs a far more serious person than they are, but of course she still loves them a lot and can‚Äôt imagine better parents.But there‚Äôs one thing that drives her crazy. Three years ago, her mom gave birth to her baby brother, and her dad got a new, better-paid job. The difference was that he had to move a lot from town to town, staying no more than 3-6 months in each place. Mom and dad were of course delighted by this turn of events ‚Äì they would have the chance to return to their youth and live the nomadic lifestyle they adore the most. But Elaine was terrified. They couldn‚Äôt just let dad go off while the rest of the family remained in one place ‚Äì being separated from your loved ones even for 3 months is too long. So they would have to follow him everywhere he went.Elaine remembers packing her bags, and just crying ‚Äì she was leaving behind everything that she loved so much ‚Äì her friends, grandparents, everything. But her mom has always known how to comfort her effectively: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt cry sweetie,. You‚Äôll get to see the whole country, and if you‚Äôre lucky even the whole world! Life will be so interesting, and we‚Äôll always be together!‚Äù Her mom won her over, and off they went into the world.They were in city #1. Elaine went to a new school; she tried to socialize with new people; found a couple of youth clubs to join and all in all managed to establish a sense of regularity to her life once more. But as soon as she started enjoying it ‚Äì ta-daaam! They were on the move again. She found herself crying and packing her bags again.Any child would find this lifestyle tough, let alone a home bird like Elaine. First she tried her best to adapt. Then, she was desperate to leave. Then she became passive, and at some point didn‚Äôt even bother to talk to people in the latest school she found herself in ‚Äì they would be temporary friends for her anyway. Naturally, her grades went down. At some point, Elaine fell into a kind of depression, preferring to stay home and not talk to anyone. Funnily enough, her friends list on social media was overflowing while she in reality had no one to talk to. Each new request from her parents to pack the bags now made her obey passively, and there were no longer any tears. Her mom became worried, and asked what was going on.Elaine had been keeping it all inside for far too long. She burst into tears and started shouting that she couldn‚Äôt handle being a nomad anymore, that she wanted to go to university but her grades were hopelessly low, that she didn‚Äôt have a single close friend to talk to and that generally, she was scared to get close to people because she knew in advance that leaving them would be painful. Her mom looked puzzled. Can you imagine that it didn‚Äôt even occur to her parents that she might be unhappy? But for Elaine, it was so freaking obvious.That‚Äôs how her parents made the hard decision to send her back to her grandparents to allow her to improve her grades at school, regain her social life, and all in all calm down emotionally. After all, it‚Äôs way better this way for everyone, even if she misses them a lot. The only thing she regrets is that she didn‚Äôt speak up and express her true feelings earlier, because she lost 3 years to suffering when she could have just talked to her parents and found a compromise.Music by Epidemic Sound: https://www.epidemicsound.com"

Spending 11 days in the Amazon rainforest, at 17 years old, she had to remain mentally strong gathering all of her strength and her will to survive. A true story, Juliane only had 1 shoe and 1 eye to see out of. Being separated from the entire plane wreckage, she knew she had to find her way out if she wanted to survive. The thick Amazon rainforest made it difficult for rescues to find the plane, let alone her! She tried so desperately to find her mother, but in her fragile state, she had to worry about herself first. Not knowing if she would ever be found, she took a chance and followed a river hoping it would be her shot at finding people. Her gamble paid off when she managed to find a resting post where the next day, people found her and quickly transported her to a hospital. Out of 91 passengers, she is the only survivor of the Lansa Flight 508. She not only survived a plane crash but survived it falling nearly 3 1/2 Burj Khalifa's (tallest building in the world) without any life-threatening injuries and survived 11 days on her own in the Amazon rainforest. Showing the will to survive, her story shows us how strong, resilient, and determined someone can be when faced with the most difficult challenges."

But unlike most teenagers, she spends much of her time living in a hospital as a cystic fibrosis patient. Her life is full of routines, boundaries and self-control -- all of which is put to the test when she meets an impossibly charming fellow CF patient named Will Newman (Cole Sprouse).There‚Äôs an instant flirtation, though restrictions dictate that they must maintain a safe distance between them. As their connection intensifies, so does the temptation to throw the rules out the window and embrace that attraction. Further complicating matters is Will‚Äôs potentially dangerous rebellion against his ongoing medical treatment. Stella gradually inspires Will to live life to the fullest, but can she ultimately save the person she loves when even a single touch is off limits?#FiveFeetApart // IN THEATERS EVERYWHERE MARCH 22, 2019"
