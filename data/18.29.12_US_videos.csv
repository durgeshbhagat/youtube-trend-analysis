But let’s start from the beginning.Monica’s mom died when she was around 3 years old, and it made her dad miserable, because he loved her very much. For years he was single, not even daring to start dating again, but when she was 14, he met Taylor. She sort of looked like her mother, but she wasn’t anything like her in terms of character.Her dad asked her if she would be okay with them being together, and of course she said yes, because she wanted him to be happy. Soon they got married and Taylor moved in with them together with her son James, who was 12 at the time. At first everything was alright – her dad and Taylor clearly loved each other very much, and James was quite easy-going. She hadn’t seen her dad so happy in years!But soon, she started to notice that Taylor was manipulating him. She would always make him adapt to her lifestyle and if she did something wrong, she turned everything around, so it was Monica’s dad who was “at fault”. Monica herself wasn’t having any of it, and Taylor began to dislike her attitude and started treating her badly, and always blamed her if something went wrong. Even if James did something, it was her fault.For example, she would get angry at her because she didn’t wash the dishes, even if there was only one dirty plate and James had eaten from it. It was HER who got lectured by Taylor. And that’s the least of the things she would say or do. At first her dad tried to defend Monica, but Taylor eventually made him think that she was right, and that she was a spoiled, ungrateful kid. She told him that Monica was stealing money, which wasn’t true and she doesn’t know where she got the idea from.By this point, their entire “family” turned on her: Taylor was as condescending as ever, and if she tried to defend herself, her dad would say, “don’t talk with your mother like that”. Of course, she would always answer: “she’s not my mother and she never will be”, which would make her dad angry.And James listened to all of this and started to see her as a villain too, and Taylor did her best to turn him against her as well. Why did Taylor do that? She probably didn’t like how much attention her father was giving her, which was understandable, because she was his DAUGHTER. Ugh.Realizing that Taylor had taken over their lives, she tried to talk to her dad, but he wouldn’t listen. So she approached her grandparents, explained the situation to them, and asked if she could move in with them. They said yes, as they also disliked Taylor very much.She moved out, and both her and Taylor were happy about it. After a year, it felt like she wasn’t part of the family at all. She saw her father just two times a month at best. At worst, they could go for two months without seeing each other. One day, he called her and said: “Honey, please come home, I talked with Taylor and she is okay with it”. Seriously? TAYLOR is OKAY with it? She rudely answered: “I won’t ever step inside that house while she’s still there”.She expected her dad to call, to apologize, to try to fix things, but it never happened. She understood that he was afraid to be lonely again, and she didn’t mind him having a partner, but it wasn’t okay how she treated her. Nothing helped, even when her grandparents tried to talk about it with him, so she completely gave up on him.Two years passed, and he was still with her, but he was miserable again. By this point she felt like her grandparents were her parents, and she had a lot of things going on in her life – her first serious boyfriend, school, and other stuff, so she didn’t even think about her family problems anymore.Then one day, to her surprise, James wrote to her on Facebook. He said how sorry he was about how she had been treated, and that he didn’t understand it at the time, but he wanted them to be friends, or at least not enemies. She asked him what had made him do what he did, and he told her all about his mom, Taylor, and how she only got crazier with time.Later, she met with James and she was honestly proud of him, because he was such a smart, good guy. He said that her dad was much better to him than his real father had ever been, and Taylor got mad every time he took his side. He said that he saw that her dad was tired, and maybe someday he would finally separate from her. James wanted them to be friends, even siblings, and support each other, and even if her dad and Taylor separated, he wanted to stay in touch.Monica doesn’t know what will happen in the future, and she’s still hurt about “losing” her dad, but at least she’s found a new family member who is a good person."

In this episode of Vox Almanac, Phil Edwards explores the history and controversy behind the style.Known as tonsure, the typical monk hairstyle has many variations throughout religions. The particular hairstyle worn by Christian monks has its own variations and controversies as well.  Three different types of tonsure were popular: a coronal tonsure, a Pauline tonsure, and a third Celtic tonsure that came to represent the differences between the Roman Catholic and Celtic Catholic church.The winding path of this tonsure is a new way to look at the division within the religion and the unpredictable ways something like hair can represent faith.Support our work and get a peek behind the scenes at Vox by joining the Vox Video Lab, our members community on YouTube.

Haunted by an unexplainable and unresolved trauma from her past and compounded by a string of eerie coincidences, Adelaide feels her paranoia elevate to high-alert as she grows increasingly certain that something bad is going to befall her family.After spending a tense beach day with their friends, the Tylers (Emmy winner Elisabeth Moss, Tim Heidecker, Cali Sheldon, Noelle Sheldon), Adelaide and her family return to their vacation home. When darkness falls, the Wilsons discover the silhouette of four figures holding hands as they stand in the driveway. Us pits an endearing American family against a terrifying and uncanny opponent: doppelgängers of themselves. Writer and director Peele produces for his Monkeypaw Productions alongside Sean McKittrick, Jason Blum, and Monkeypaw’s Ian Cooper. Us will be released by Universal Pictures on Friday, March 15, 2019."

Comment, like, share this story.You all know who Lilly Singh is, right? How could you not? She's an actress, a comedian, a huge YouTube star, and a social media celebrity of the highest degree! She also has a huge heart and believes in empowering young woman (and everybody for that matter) to be their best most powerful selves. Lilly Singh is amazing, and we're sure she always has been BUT before she was famous she was just a kid doing all those things kids do - hanging out with friends and family (she has lots of cousins), playing video games, and finding ways not to be bored, like watching horror movies and telling each other scary stories, and playing with each others imaginations.When she was younger all of her cousins would go to her house to hang out with her and her sister. The parents would all head off to work and the kids would all look after each other - immigranthustle. One day, just after their parents left, they were all piled onto the couch playing video games when the phone rang. Her older cousin answered it, said hello a few times, but nobody was there. Weird, but maybe just a wrong number, or at worst a crank call.Lilly and her cousins got back to their video game, and had played for a little while when the phone rang again. This time another cousin answered and the same thing happened, nobody was on the other end, or at least they weren't saying anything. It was a little scary, what kind of evil demon of a person would do that to a bunch of kids?At that point Lilly and her cousins could have come up with some good rational reasons for the phone calls - like a wrong number, a bad connection, a telemarketer, etc. BUT that's not what a bunch of kids home alone do, so instead they came up with a whole story about how some evil demon or person was trying to get to them and do bad things!They decided they needed a master plan, a way to make sure their story didn't turn out to be a scary horror story. Now, keep in mind, this was right around Christmas and they had just finished doing a Home Alone marathon.They began by documenting all of the calls that came in and capturing  every detail. This would help them come up with their plan for scaring away the evil demon, or whatever - the evil telemarketer. On day three they received more calls than usual and they felt it was definitely a sign. They brainstormed their plan.Was it a robber? A spirit? A demon? The possibilities were endless. Their planning was interrupted when one of their cousins stopped them as said hey, didn't you guys hear that? Now, Lilly hadn't heard anything, but what was the fun of that, and, if there was some demonic Christmas Home Alone presence there with them, she didn't want to be the first to go just because she didn't believe it was real. She wasn't going to be THAT kid in the horror movie. Or one of those ghost stories. It was time to take action. They all gathered up all the utensils from the kitchen drawers and then executed their plan : lock themselves in their parents bedroom and wait it out. But before they locked themselves  in the room they strategically placed three little porcelain pigs in the hallway that could warn them if something trampled that way.Hours went by with them locked in the bedroom, pacing, sweating, stressing and terrified. But, eventually their need for Oreos overcame them so they ventured into the kitchen and felt so relieved, and silly for acting so scared and ridiculous. UNTIL they noticed that one of the little pigs had been knocked over.They freaked out, and around the house, and then finally decided it was time to take a stand - it was either them, or the demon! They searched the entire house with their forks and butter knives ready. But of course, they found nothing.A couple of hours later her parents returned home and all their cousins left. End of story, right? Well, they never felt anymore evil presences, and the phone stopped ringing, but, you never know.

At just over a year old, the colossal pup is already closing in on his world famous 175lb dad - and still has plenty of growing left to do. And Kong has already built up a loyal following on social media, with fans won over by his huge frame and goofy smile. Kong’s story is featured in the new season of Barcroft TV’s hit online show Dog Dynasty, which has racked up more than 150 million views on YouTube and Facebook. The show follows the fortunes of Hulk and New Hampshire-based dog breeders, Dark Dynasty K9s, who sell protection dogs for between $5000 and $25,000. The show has catapulted Hulk to global superstardom, with the lovable giant having his own dog food brand and merchandise line.  ***Dog Dynasty season 3 is available on Barcroft Animals YouTube page and the Dog Dynasty Facebook Watch page.***Video Credits:Director of Photography: Adam GrayProducer/Director: Tom MidlaneSeries Producer: Ruby CooteEditor: Paul ZellerExecutive Producers: Lizzie Wingham, Dom SmithBarcroft TV: https://www.youtube.com/user/barcroftmedia/featuredBarcroft Animals: https://www.youtube.com/barcroftanimals/featuredBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featuredFor more of the amazing side of life:For the full story, visit ANIMALS.BARCROFT.TV: http://animals.barcroft.tv/Like @BarcroftAnimals on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/BarcroftAnimals/Follow @BarcroftAnimals on Twitter: https://twitter.com/BarcroftAnimalsCheck out more videos: https://www.youtube.com/barcroftanimals/videosDownload the Barcroft TV iOS app: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/barcroft-tv/id1287734327?mt=8Download Barcroft TV on Android: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.recipe.barcroft&hl=en"

Even at 5:30 am when we arrived it was vibrant and busy, and action packed. It was a good start to the day, because especially when I eat seafood, I love to visit the fish market and get a sense of the seafood available before eating it. We also stopped at the fisherman canteen for a quick local Pakistani Karachi breakfast of paratha and chai.We drove out to the beach house, about an hour from the center of Karachi, along the Arabian sea. Already, the seafood feast was underway. There’s was both a full grill section of seafood, and a full curry section.Everything was delicious, but the highlight were the crab lollipops, mostly crab claws and arms, which were tossed in a beautiful curry sauce. It was spectacular.And this seafood meal was the perfect way to end an amazing trip to Pakistan!-----End of Pakistan video series:For 16 Days the People of Pakistan greeted us with respect and hospitality, allowed me to film, invited us into their homes, and many, even refused to let us to pay for food we ate... and the list goes on. Thank you to the People of Pakistani for your amazing hospitality and welcome. Thank you to Ali for hosting us and for arranging and coordinating everything - without Ali this trip wouldn’t have been possible.

The Doom Patrol's members each suffered horrible accidents that gave them superhuman abilities — but also left them scarred and disfigured. Traumatized and downtrodden, the team found purpose through The Chief, who brought them together to investigate the weirdest phenomena in existence — and to protect Earth from what they find. Part support group, part Super Hero team, the Doom Patrol is a band of super-powered freaks who fight for a world that wants nothing to do with them. Picking up after the events of TITANS, DOOM PATROL will find these reluctant heroes in a place they never expected to be, called to action by none other than Cyborg, who comes to them with a mission hard to refuse, but with a warning that is hard to ignore: their lives will never, ever be the same.Based on DC characters originally written and drawn by Arnold Drake, Bob Haney and Bruno Premiani#DCUDOOMPATROL premieres February 15.

Go to https://NordVPN.com/MarkRober and use code MARKROBER to get 75% off a 3 year plan and an extra month for free.My buddy Sean posted a video with more details of the build: https://youtu.be/IpMxOmUcfOINote about 2 missing the reactions in the video- I was presented with information that caused me to doubt the veracity of 2 of the 5 reactions in the video.  These were reactions that were captured during a two week period while the device was at house 2 hours away from where I live.  I put a feeler out for people willing to put a package on their porch and this person (who is a friend of a friend) volunteered to help.  To compensate them for their time and willingness to risk putting a package on their porch I offered financial compensation for any successful recoveries of the package.  It appears (and I've since confirmed) in these two cases, the “thieves were actually acquaintances of the person helping me.  From the footage I received from the phones which intentionally only record at specific times, this wasn’t clear to me. I have since removed those reactions from the original video (originally 6:26-7:59).  I’m really sorry about this.  Ultimately, I am responsible for the content that goes on my channel and I should have done more here.  I can vouch for that the reactions were genuine when the package was taken from my house.  Having said that,  I know my credibly is sort of shot but I encourage you to look at the types of videos I’ve been making for the past 7 years.  This is my first ever video with some kind of “prank and like I mentioned in the video it’s pretty removed from my comfort zone and I should have done more.  I’m especially gutted because so much thought, time, money and effort went into building the device and I hope this doesn’t just taint the entire effort as “fake.  It genuinely works (like all the other things I’ve built on my channel) and we’ve made all the code and build info public.  Again, I’m sorry for putting something up on my channel that was misleading.  That is totally on me and I will take all necessary steps to make sure it won’t happen again.High Speed camera courtesy of https://www.aimed-research.com/.

What software do you use?A. Simon's Cat has been made using a variety of animation software over the years. Originally in Adobe Flash. Then TV Paint (and still on occasions) and most recently using CelAction.Q. Why does it take so long to make each Simon's Cat film?A. Animation is a slow process and Simon’s Cat films pay particular attention to observed, real life cat behaviour. Historically the films were traditionally animated frame by frame. More recently we use CelAction which has sped up the process but still requires a lot of care and attention. Each film takes approximately 6-9 weeks to make, depending on complexity, number of characters and special effects.#HappyHolidays #SnowballFight"

Quand je l’ai filmée, je me suis presque endormie.Ensuite, j'ai mangé la mousse florale sèche, elle avait un goût bizarre et vraiment sec (NE PAS l'essayer à la maison).J'ai versé de l'eau sur la mousse florale sèche qui a tout absorbé.J'ai saupoudré de paillettes vertes colorées à l'extérieur de la mousse florale.Puis j'ai saupoudré les paillettes rouges à l'intérieur.Pour les graines je mets mon doigt dans la mousse florale, c'était vraiment satisfaisant.Après cela, la mousse florale avec des paillettes ressemblait à un melon d'eau, alors j'ai un peu faim.J'ai attrapé la pastèque et l'ai mangée, l'eau coulait de l'écume florale, comme une vraie pastèque.Diese Videos enthalten ASMR-Sounds wie: Trinken, Schlucken, Essen, Kauen, aber kein Sprechen.WARNUNG: Essen ist NICHT echt, probieren Sie es nicht zu Hause!Ich habe Blumenschaum / Oase im Art Store mit grünem und rotem Glitter gekauft (Baumarkt).Ich schnitt den Blumenschaum für die entspannenden und prickelnden ASMR-Klänge ab, als ich ihn filmte, schlief ich fast ein.Dann habe ich den trockenen Blumenschaum gegessen, er schmeckte seltsam und wirklich trocken (probieren Sie das nicht zu Hause).Ich schüttete etwas Wasser auf den trockenen Blumenschaum und er saugte alles Wasser auf.Ich streute etwas bunten grünen Glitzer auf die Außenseite des Blumenschaums.Dann streute ich die roten Glitzer innen.Für die Samen stecke ich meinen Finger in den Blumenschaum, es war wirklich befriedigend.Danach sah der Blumenschaum mit Glitzern aus wie eine Wassermelone, so dass ich etwas hungrig wurde.Ich schnappte mir die Wassermelone und aß sie, das Wasser tropfte wie eine echte Wassermelone aus dem Blütenschaum.Autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR) is a euphoric experience characterized by a static-like or tingling sensation on the skin that typically begins on the scalp and moves down the back of the neck and upper spine, precipitating relaxation."

The new story follows the heroic efforts of the crypto-zoological agency Monarch as its members face off against a battery of god-sized monsters, including the mighty Godzilla, who collides with Mothra, Rodan, and his ultimate nemesis, the three-headed King Ghidorah.

Panda buns are a great way to start out since they are so cheap, easy to find and such a simple shape!Here's where you can find some of your own panda buns (AFFILIATE):https://amzn.to/2PsIFxDWATCH THE WHOLE MAKEOVER SERIES: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...Wanna see unedited squishy makeovers, behind the scenes footage, biweekly video updates and get access to exclusive polls and q&as?CHECK OUT MY NEW PATREON: https://www.patreon.com/moriahelizabeth________ Materials List__________http://www.moriah.video/materials.html_________FAQs__________1. CAN I SEND YOU SQUISHIES?So many generous people have sent me their unwanted squishies so I actually have a lot to work on already. BUT if you have squishies that you really don't want anymore, email me at fanmail@moriah.video to request my P.O. box address :).2. ARE SQUISHIES RETURNED TO THE SENDERS AFTER THE MAKEOVER?No. Everyone gave me these squishies as donations to the series because they were no longer wanted. Everyone has been informed in advance that squishies would not be returned. It would be completely impossible for me financially to send back squishies. Just to RECEIVE these squishies costs me hundreds of dollars (I have to pay for P.O. box fees) There are MANY other reasons as well, I explained it in this video if you want to know the full list of reasons: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKYCV...3. WHAT PAINT DO YOU USE?I use fabric paint. Fabric paint is meant to stretch, so it is perfect for squishing! Any brand will work fine, but I mainly use Tulip and Scribbles. You can find it at Michaels, Hobby Lobby, A.C. Moore, Walmart, Joann Fabrics, and Online.4. IS PUFFY PAINT THE SAME AS FABRIC PAINT?Yep!! Puffy paint is just a type of fabric paint.5. WILL FABRIC PAINT CRACK?The matte fabric paint is more likely to crack after lots of squishing. Slick fabric paints never crack. But there are benefits to both. I usually mix the two paints together to get the best of both worlds.6. CAN I USE ACRYLIC PAINT ON SQUISHIES?I would not recommend that. Acrylic paint will either make the squishy hard, or it will crack and flake off. 7. WHAT MEMORY FOAM DO YOU USE?I usually just buy a memory foam pillow on Amazon.com and use that to cut up.8. CAN YOU DO MORE SQUISHIES IN EACH VIDEO OR DO MAKEOVER VIDEOS EVERY WEEK?I wish I could! But these videos take me about 30-50 hours to film and edit (not including waiting for the paint to dry or any breaks). And usually about 8 or 9 days of working on it. So it’s not really possible to do these any more than I am already doing without lowering the quality. PLUS! I want to keep up with my Monday videos and my art and craft videos as well ☺9. WHY DO YOU SOMETIMES USE A POPSICLE STICK AND OTHER TIMES USE A PAINTBRUSH TO APPLY PAINT?The “slick” fabric paint has a very thick consistency that does not spread easily with a paint brush. Using a popsicle stick is much easier for this type of paint. BUT the matte fabric paint is much thinner, similar consistency to acrylic paint and it can easily be applied with a paintbrush. When you mix the two, you can get away with a paintbrush as well :)10. WHY DO YOU LIKE RAINBOW SO MUCH?I just like color, and I think rainbows are pretty. There’s really no other reason for my obsession hahaPURCHASE ME PRODUCTSCREATE THIS BOOK:https://amzn.to/2vUerfICREATE THIS BOOK 2:https://amzn.to/2Nx2G9fME MERCH:https://teespring.com/stores/moriah-elizabethGET TO KNOW MEBECOME A PATRON (GET ACCESS TO EXCLUSIVE CONTENT):https://www.patreon.com/moriahelizabethVISIT ME WEBSITE:http://www.moriah.video/INSTAGRAM: instagram.com/moriahelizabethofficialCONTACT MEEMAIL PICTURES OF YOUR ART:Artwork@Moriah.videoFOR BUSINESS INQUIRIES ONLY:Business@Moriah.video_MAIL ME_For sending squishies, Letters, or general fan mail, please contact: FANMAIL@MORIAH.VIDEO to request my P.O. box address :)MUSIC CREDITS:Intro Music by: SHIFTYPOPMusic: Love Light and Twinkles by JivingGerbil (link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwaUO...)Chee Zee Jungle - Primal Drive by Kevin MacLeod is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)Source: http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1100684Artist: http://incompetech.com/"
