Her dad is a very simple person, a self-made-man, and he wants his children to work their own way through life too. That doesn’t mean that they have strict limitations on using money – his belief is that they need to invest their time and effort in studying, and should work like everyone else who is not as lucky as they are. That’s why they have always lived a pretty simple life – not in some mansion, but in an ordinary house. Their dad also insisted that they go to an ordinary school, not some fancy private one.When Britney was a child, she didn’t even notice the difference between herself and other children. They all shared the same studies and hobbies. She’s a very sociable person, so she didn’t have problems finding friends. But when she became a teenager and went to high school, she noticed that things had changed. Everyone was divided into groups and ranks – it was not just one big group of children anymore. She didn’t like the idea of classifying people, but you have to adapt in order to enjoy life.Since she is quite easy-going, she ended up in the “celeb” group. This wasn’t her goal, of course, but she was at a new school and she just wanted to make friends. They came to her and proposed that she hang out with them – why would she say no? They seemed like really nice people. They chatted a lot about designer clothes and gadgets, and all the other things that are trendy nowadays. This was when she found out that they had somehow already learned about who she was and what family she was from – and Britney began to have doubts. She’s not a fool, and she understands that sometimes people can be guided by self-interest when choosing friends.She started watching her new friends attentively. Her dad had taught her that you should always check people out before trusting them, even if she had never been in a situation where she’d been right to mistrust people before. But everything seemed okay. It was quite a large group of people – there were eight of them – and they all had different backgrounds. They were regular people with different personalities – that’s ok then, she thought. They spent a lot of time together, and met outside school as well, and as time passed she didn’t notice any particular interest in her family’s wealth.When things started changing, she didn’t even notice at first. From time to time when they went out, one or two of her friends asked her to pay for their movie tickets or a coffee, and promised to give back the money. They never gave it back, and she thought it was a bit petty to remind them. Then...their ‘appetites’ started growing. Sometimes they asked her to pay for a round of bowling or a coffee for everyone. She didn’t think it was fair, but they were her friends and she thought it was shameful to quarrel over money. Britney became irritated by the situation, and started thinking: “What if they made friends with me only because of my money? What if they don’t even really like me?”At some point, thinking these kinds of thoughts over again and again leads you to paranoia.  She wanted to check if they really liked just her money or her. She already had trust issues, and thought that it would be better to be alone than with friends like that. So one day she met up with them and pretended to be all sad, saying that they had financial problems at home – that her dad had lost his business and that he had cut her pocket money drastically. She saw them exchange glances but they didn’t say anything. Everything continued as normal and she had already begun to calm down, but when they decided to go to the cinema, she asked someone to pay for her. “I’m broke”, she said, “sorry guys, I’ll give it back as soon as I can”. They exchanged glances again. Then one of her supposed friends said: “Look, we’re not as rich as you are and we can’t sponsor you, sorry. Maybe it’d be better if you go another time”.That was it. Now she knew! How could she even think that someone could be disinterested in her family’s money! She was staring at their backs as they were walking away feeling so disappointed, and she didn’t notice that Lea was still standing by her side. She asked if Britney needed help. “Do you need to talk? I understand it can be hard”. She offered to pay for her as they went to get a coffee. She thanked Lea from the bottom of her heart, because she had restored her faith in people. They’ve been best friends ever since, and she never went back to the ‘celeb’ group."

Comment, like, share this story.Bella lives in a neighborhood called Squirrel Hill in Pittsburgh. She's grown up there, lived there her whole life, has her friends and her synagogue there, right near the Tree of Life synagogue, and it had always been a peaceful neighborhood - diverse and accepting - a really nice place to live. There were a lot of Jewish families who lived there and she could hardly remember any anti semitism ever happening around them.But, on Saturday, October 27th, she slept in late and only woke up when her mom called to her from the other room at around eleven o'clock. She ran in to her Mom's room and her younger sister was there and they looked awful, pale, afraid and scared. Bella didn't know what was going on, and her mom would only whisper because she didn't want Bella's youngest sister to wake up. But something really, really bad was going on - you could tell from the terrified looks on her Mom and sister.Her mom asked is she'd looked at her phone yet, if she'd seen or heard any of what was on the news. She'd heard lots of sirens in her half sleep, but they didn't wake her - what was going on? Her mom sat her down and told her that there had been a mass shooting at a temple - the Tree of Life synagogue right there in squirrel hill. Bella gasped and sat down hard. She was so scared, afraid, shaking and crying. She was just in shock that something like this had happened, in their neighborhood, at a synagogue that was practically right next to the one she attended. Also, the fact that it was all because of their religion, all because they were Jewish, and this scared Bella too - the ant-semitism, and all these shootings taking place everywhere.What made the tragedy even worse was the fact that it was Shabbat, the holiest day of the week for the Jewish people -- all they were doing was praying -- and that morning the Tree of Life synagogue was having a baby naming for a new baby just born into their community, a special and festive and happy occasion. And an evil man full of hate and anti semitism came into their place of worship and shot and killed 11 people, including police and security guards.When Bella and her friends returned to their religious school, hebrew school, so many of them were on edge, scared, and couldn't quite put into words how awful and vulnerable it made them feel. Why was there anti semitism, or hate of any kind? Why couldn't people coexist without hatred and gun violence?After they had started their school day they had a special morning prayer service and they invited the congregation from the Tree of Life synagogue to join them. There were so many people there, mourning and praying, holding hands and supporting each other - praying for peace, and love, and for the souls of the those who passed to ascend. And they chanted and sang words of power, that they were strong and that they would not be afraid.The Pittsburgh synagogue shooting has effected jews all over the United States and the world, and all people who enjoy feeling safe and free to worship how they choose under any religion they choose. Hopefully the families affected by this tragedy will be able to feel one day that those they lost did not die in vain and that they re-awakened the need for peace, and love, and light across the entire world._____What's your story?  storybooth wants to hear it!  actually happenedLINKS:Website: http://www.storybooth.comInstagram: @thestorybooth twitter @thestorybooth https://www.instagram.com/thestoryboothG+: https://plus.google.com/+StoryboothFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/thestorybooth/Tumblr: https://storybooth.tumblr.com/If you liked this storybooth animation and love storytime / story time story booth kid videos, watch our themed playlist collections:Being Yourself: https://goo.gl/89enENLove and Heartbreak: https://goo.gl/mfaoKwEmbarrassing and Funny: https://goo.gl/5GjxrWBullies and Mean People:https://goo.gl/THS3LBOvercoming Challenges: https://goo.gl/pbxRa9"

I combined the two days because things didn’t work out as planned on Day 9, and so didn’t end up being able to film much. But that’s the way things go sometimes!So firstly, on Day 9, the plan was to drive from Shigar to to Deosai National Park, and drive all the way through the park to the other side, en-route to Gilgit. Unfortunately it started snowing along the way, and by the time we arrived to the entrance of the park, it was snowing too hard, and it was too risky to proceed. So we turned around and took the long way to Gilgit.Gilgit, Gilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan - Ok, so now back to today (Day 10) we started the morning with a street food tour of Gilgit. Gilgit is an amazing small town, sort of the gateway of Gilgit Baltistan, and a commerce hub for the region on the Karakoram highway. The town is extremely friendly, and everywhere we went to eat on this small market and street food tour, we were greeted with such friendliness and hospitality.Kabuli pulao - 140 PKR ($1.04)Grilled meat - 120 PKR ($0.89)Curry - 120 PKR ($0.89)After about an hour eating street food and walking around the market, we continued on to Nizam’s house, which was about a 15 minute drive from the center of Gilgit. Nizam is an employee of Ali, and he graciously invited us to his amazing home in the countryside. The view from the backyard was breathtaking.We first went to the river valley to pick vegetables where we met Nizam’s father in law, who again may be the happiest man on earth - he was amazing pounding the chilies. We picked vegetables, and just stood in amazement at the natural wonder beauty of Pakistan. Lunch was incredibly delicious, all the fresh vegetables we picked, plus both mutton and beef curry, with rice and roti. The curries were some of the best I ate in Pakistan, but the fresh mountain vegetables, sauteed down with dried tomato, were the highlight. An incredible meal, really one of the most memorable I had in my entire trip to Pakistan.Thank you Nizam and family for the amazing meal!Watch the entire Pakistani video series: https://youtu.be/Xdya8eym9nMAli: https://goo.gl/VY6NjHJoel: https://goo.gl/5AkWm6MUSIC: https://us.audionetwork.com/Logo: https://goo.gl/VhaLp5CAMERA GEAR I used to make this video (these are affiliate links):Main camera: http://amzn.to/2sV0XQOMain lens: http://amzn.to/2szLZNf2nd lens: http://amzn.to/2EjBeEgMicrophone: http://amzn.to/2rBKD3zDrone: http://amzn.to/2CrtAHzFOLLOW:Instagram: @migrationologyFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationologyThank you for watching!"

Fox has been asking for a PG-13 basically since the start in 2006, Ryan Reynolds told Deadline. I've said no since 2006. Now, this one time, I said 'Yes' on two conditions. First, a portion of the proceeds had to go to charity. Second, I wanted to kidnap Fred Savage. The second condition took some explaining...Fred Savage will join Reynolds in new scenes for ONCE UPON A DEADPOOL in an homage to Savage's starring role in the 1987 bedtime-story classic THE PRINCESS BRIDE. Fred remarked, “while my participation in this film was anything but voluntary, I am happy to learn that Fudge Cancer will be the beneficiary of this shameless cash grab”For every ticket sold, $1 will go to the charity Fudge Cancer - previously known as Fuck Cancer, who have graciously changed their name to be more PG-13 friendly for the 12 days of Once Upon A Deadpool’s release.#OnceUponADeadpoolConnect with Deadpool Online: https://fox.co/OnceUponADeadpoolMovieSiteLike Deadpool on FACEBOOK: http://fox.co/DeadpoolFBFollow Deadpool on TWITTER: http://fox.co/DeadpoolTwitterFollow Deadpool on INSTAGRAM: http://fox.co/DeadpoolInstagram"

She used spy gadgets and a hidden camera tracker device to sneak into the top secret laboratory. While inside they found mysterious clues about code 10 and the GM Network on his laptop. Rebecca Zamolo went home and reacted to the Game Master’s new video taking down Project Zorgo and tried to solve the mystery if they are working together. In today’s video Rebecca uses a treasure map inside the tunnel that leads her to an abandoned swimming pool where she finds a key hidden in the water. Matt and Rebecca hide behind a rock to spy on a secret meeting between the GameMaster and Pumpkin Patch along with two other mystery men ninjas. Using spy gadgets we heard mysterious code words then watched them each receive a final mystery note. Matt began secretly chasing Pumpkin Patch while I followed the Game Master into a new hidden cave.

Starring an eight year old star giving the performance of her life, all for her mum. Directed by Michael Gracey, the director of The Greatest Showman. The Show tells the story of the North Star overcoming her nerves to deliver a performance of a lifetime, to the amazement of mum. She is supported by a huge cast of 59 kids aged 6-11, all dressed as a variety of Christmas staples - including a turkey drummer and set of Christmas lights (plug included). The cast all dance and sing along as the stage transforms to reveal a 40ft Christmas tree and a 14ft glitter-filled gravy boat.The children’s real parents were featured in the crowd too, and were intentionally kept away from the castings and rehearsals until shoot day.We hope you enjoy seeing our whole cast give all they’ve got for the ones they love.Celebrate Christmas with Sainsbury's!Meet the kids behind the ad: https://youtu.be/F0XGgKStoVw 🎵: The North Star and Friends x Sainsbury’s - You Get What You GiveListen on Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/album/47EzNPreC2Dciijv8VglnzOriginal song by New Radicals.Shop online: https://www.sainsburys.co.uk/shop/gb/groceries/Christmas"
