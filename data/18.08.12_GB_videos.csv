Sometimes people are not who they seem to be, like a wolf in sheep’s clothing. Her story is about a person exactly like that.About a year ago, Jenny’s family moved to a new city, so inevitably she had to adapt to a new school, and the hardest part was making new friends. Jenny got along with her classmates, but not to the point where she actually became friends with them.That all changed during one of her classes, when she sat next to Rachel. She stood out compared to the other kids – she dressed differently, talked differently and seemed much smarter than everybody else. Jenny really wanted to get acquainted with her, but didn’t know how. Luckily enough though, Rachel did it herself!One day, she passed a note to Jenny with a question: “what’s your favorite band?” She gave her answer, and then Rachel wrote her favorite one. They kept exchanging little letters like this, and it was a very cute way of getting to know each other, especially when you’re bored in class.Long story short, Jenny learned that they had a lot in common, and they immediately hit it off. In just a few weeks they became best friends. Soon everybody took it for granted that Rachel and Jenny were always together – at school, outside school, and if someone invited one of them to a party, they knew that both of them would come. It was magical! Jenny looked up to Rachel – she knew everything, from fashion to movies and art. She wanted to be a little bit like her. What could go wrong?But soon, the first warning signals began to appear. Jenny had been saving money for months to buy these new awesome sneakers, and she was super-happy when she could finally afford them. She proudly went to school in them, and she couldn’t wait to show them to Rachel!Jenny expected that Rachel would be happy for her, but instead she just said: “Oh, finally I won’t be ashamed to be seen with you in public!” Um, okay, that was weird and not what she’d expected, but okay, it was a joke.But then it happened again, and again – she made snarky comments about Jenny’s looks, her taste in music, and even about her in general. Every time she made it look like a joke, but Jenny still noticed her sarcastic smile and how she rolled her eyes every time something was said that she didn’t like.And if Jenny got upset or tried to confront her, she always said: “it’s just a joke, stop over-reacting.” And what can you do in response to that? It made her paranoid. She kept thinking – maybe she was too touchy about it, and she should take it as it was apparently intended, as a joke?When they were with other people, Rachel’s comments would get even worse, and yet she still took it all without any objections.Then she started bailing on Jenny regularly – for example, they were meant to meet at the mall to go to a concert, but she didn’t show up and then said she had forgotten. It happened a few times, sometimes even during the same week.At first, she was upset, but then she realized that by this time she had made a lot of other friends, so she started hanging out more with them and less with Rachel. She even met a guy who she liked, and she thought that he liked her as well.And you know what? All of this made Rachel increasingly reveal her true self. She started sending her angry texts about how Jenny had betrayed her and wasn’t a real friend...then begged forgiveness, saying that she was very lonely and couldn’t live without her. Jenny thought to herself: “enough is enough”, and told her that she was not okay with the way she treated her and that she didn’t want to be friends anymore. She called her 20 times in a row but Jenny blocked her, because by now she knew that Rachel didn’t respect her.Funnily enough, the story didn’t stop there. Jenny started dating the boy she liked, and everything seemed good until she noticed that he was talking with Rachel at school. Jenny assumed the worst and asked him what she had said to him.It turned out that Rachel had said that he should stop dating her because she was a horrible person and would betray him the same way Jenny had betrayed her. Jenny asked if he believed her, and thankfully, he laughed and said of course not.Jenny’s still a bit upset about Rachel being such a toxic person, but she’s glad that she noticed it soon enough and didn’t let herself be manipulated.Music by Epidemic Sound: https://www.epidemicsound.com"

Of all the cities I visited in Pakistan, Peshawar was one of the most special, a city of immense history, culture, and some of the most incredible meat dishes of anywhere in the world. People have huge hearts, and a great taste of delicious food. Thank you Waqas and Peshawar for an amazing street food tour!Halwa puri - We started off this Peshawar street food tour with first breakfast, halwa puri, something that is loved throughout Pakistan. Their version was one of the best, fried in pure desi ghee, and what I loved most was the chana, chickpeas stew.Nika Seri Pai - Breakfast number two was one of the best dishes I ate in all of Pakistan - Peshawari seri paye, this version made with stewed cows feet. The stew was so rich and incredibly thick - like one of the most rich things you could possibly eat. What I loved so much about Peshawari paye is that it had an incredible garlic flavor. The meat was fall apart tender melting as well.Price - 500 PKR ($3.73) per bowlSir Cunningham Clock Tower - After breakfast we headed to walk around and explore Peshawar, which has some ancient history, and is a fascinating city to explore. Masjid Mahabat Khan is one of the oldest and landmark mosques in Peshawar that’s well worth a visit.Brains masala - 90 PKR ($0.67) - After having some amazing Peshawari tea, we then continued on to eat brains masala, which he literally whipped up in minutes, and we had a fresh plate of cow brains masala. It was delicious especially with the added chutney.Pomegranate juice 200 PKR ($1.49) per cup - This is a cup of juice I could hardly even believe. It was the best, freshest, and perfectly sweet and tart cup of pomegranate juice I’ve ever had.Peshawari pulao - 185 PKR ($1.38) per plate - Next on this Pakistani street food tour of Peshawar, we had Peshawari pulao, which is quite similar to Kabuli pulao. The rice was lightly seasoned, cooked with meat and chickpeas. It was awesome.Saag and lassi - 50 PKR ($0.37) - Another highlight from this amazing street food tour of Peshawar was the saag and lassi sold by an extremely friendly man right outside the pulao restaurant. The saag was so healthy and fresh, and the lassi was freshly whipped up.Kaptaan Chappal - One of the best things I brought back with me from Pakistan are Kaptaan Chappals, the locals sandals made in Pakistan. We went to the same shop that Mr. Imran Khan, Prime Minister of Pakistan, is famous for buying his sandals that he wears almost everyday.Nisar Khan Charsi Tikka Shish Mahel - Finally, a food trip to Peshawar wouldn’t be complete without eating at Nisar Khan Charsi Tikka, the most famous restaurant in Peshawar for meat, specifically lamb. Everything was incredibly good, and I especially loved the lamb chops.Total price - 2,600 PKR ($19.38)An amazing day in Peshawar, it was one of those days where everything is fascinating, everywhere you look and everything you taste.Thank you again to Waqas for taking us around: https://goo.gl/ipRiqeAli: https://goo.gl/VY6NjHJoel: https://goo.gl/5AkWm6MUSIC: https://us.audionetwork.com/Logo: https://goo.gl/VhaLp5CAMERA GEAR I used to make this video (these are affiliate links):Main camera: http://amzn.to/2sV0XQOMain lens: http://amzn.to/2szLZNf2nd lens: http://amzn.to/2EjBeEgMicrophone: http://amzn.to/2rBKD3zDrone: http://amzn.to/2CrtAHzFOLLOW:Instagram: https://instagram.com/migrationologyFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationologyThank you for watching!"

Comment, like, share this story.Since the day Zoila was born it seemed that her mom never wanted her around. Her whole young life, she was always bouncing from one friend's house to another, and never really having a home until her mom had a new baby - then she was invited to move back in. Being the oldest now, her mom wanted her to take care of her younger brothers. But she was only ten years old - overwhelmed with responsibility, stress, and pressure that not even teens or high school kids should have on them. But, she made it through elementary school and was really excited to go on to middle school, but instead her mom decided to send her to Dominican Republic to stay with her grandparents. She stayed with them until she was 16 years old when her mom finally asked that she return home and that they try to build a good relationship.For the first couple of months everything seemed to be working well. Then, a surprise to everyone, Zoila found out she was pregnant. Her mom was so mad about it that she let it ruin the relationship they were trying to build. Her mom did NOT want to have a new teenage mom around. And, after her baby was born, since she had to stay home and care for her son anyway, her mom made her take care of all her siblings just like when she was ten. It was a lot more complicated this time since she had her own baby to take care of as well.When Zoila finally decided to go back to high school it made the relationship with her mother even harder. She wanted Zoila to stay home all the time to take care of the kids and didn't want her to advance herself with school and education. Zoila refused to drop out and her mom proceeded to kick her and her new baby out of the house.She worked with her high school guidance counselor to try to find a shelter and they finally found the perfect place - Covenant House! It was a perfect solution - and a path for her to graduate. Every day she would wake up early, get ready, and drop her son off at daycare, then a full day of school, followed by an internship, homework, and then repeating the whole thing every single day. She worked so hard.In June, a couple of weeks before graduation, Zoila got a call from her guidance counselor with amazing news! She had been chosen to speak at graduation as valedictorian; graduating with honors. She was so excited, had worked so hard, and felt so proud to have been recognized like that.She had always believed that hard work pays off, as does persistence, determination, overcoming adversity, focus and sticktoitiveness.  But, she had never imagined that she would achieve such an accomplishment. Her graduation speech was all about how even when things get hard, no matter how hard they get, you should never give up. No matter how many obstacles appear in your way, you should always keep striving to achieve your goals.Having her son there to see her give her valedictorian speech - she was the top of the class - really underlined her accomplishment. She felt that not only had she accomplished something powerful for herself, but also something that would be really good for him too.Once she was finished and everyone was cheering and clapping, she saw her son jumping up and down, so excited, and it filled her with pride, hope, love and joy. teen pregnancy story time.- - -SleepOut America: https://sleepoutamerica.org/#stories#MercerCares is honored to support Covenant House and SleepOut America.

Fox has been asking for a PG-13 basically since the start in 2006, Ryan Reynolds told Deadline. I've said no since 2006. Now, this one time, I said 'Yes' on two conditions. First, a portion of the proceeds had to go to charity. Second, I wanted to kidnap Fred Savage. The second condition took some explaining...Fred Savage will join Reynolds in new scenes for ONCE UPON A DEADPOOL in an homage to Savage's starring role in the 1987 bedtime-story classic THE PRINCESS BRIDE. Fred remarked, “while my participation in this film was anything but voluntary, I am happy to learn that Fudge Cancer will be the beneficiary of this shameless cash grab”For every ticket sold, $1 will go to the charity Fudge Cancer - previously known as Fuck Cancer, who have graciously changed their name to be more PG-13 friendly for the 12 days of Once Upon A Deadpool’s release.#OnceUponADeadpoolConnect with Deadpool Online: https://fox.co/OnceUponADeadpoolMovieSiteLike Deadpool on FACEBOOK: http://fox.co/DeadpoolFBFollow Deadpool on TWITTER: http://fox.co/DeadpoolTwitterFollow Deadpool on INSTAGRAM: http://fox.co/DeadpoolInstagram"

The film also showcases a wide array of beloved Pokémon characters, each with its own unique abilities and personality.The story begins when ace private eye Harry Goodman goes mysteriously missing, prompting his 21-year-old son Tim to find out what happened. Aiding in the investigation is Harry’s former Pokémon partner, Detective Pikachu: a hilariously wise-cracking, adorable super-sleuth who is a puzzlement even to himself. Finding that they are uniquely equipped to communicate with one another, Tim and Pikachu join forces on a thrilling adventure to unravel the tangled mystery. Chasing clues together through the neon-lit streets of Ryme City—a sprawling, modern metropolis where humans and Pokémon live side by side in a hyper-realistic live-action world—they encounter a diverse cast of Pokémon characters and uncover a shocking plot that could destroy this peaceful co-existence and threaten the whole Pokémon universe.“POKÉMON Detective Pikachu” also stars Justice Smith (“Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom”) as Tim; Kathryn Newton (“Lady Bird,” TV’s “Big Little Lies”) as Lucy, a junior reporter following her first big story; and Oscar nominee Ken Watanabe (“Godzilla,” “The Last Samurai”) as Lt. Yoshida.Directed by Rob Letterman (“Goosebumps,” “Monsters Vs. Aliens”), the “POKÉMON Detective Pikachu” creative filmmaking team includes two-time Oscar nominated director of photography John Mathieson (“The Phantom of the Opera,” “Gladiator”), production designer Nigel Phelps (“Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Lies”) and Oscar-winning editor Mark Sanger (“Gravity”). Visual effects are by Moving Picture Company (“Wonder Woman”) and Framestore (“Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2”).Launched in 1996 to overwhelming response, the Pokémon brand is a global sensation that now encompasses a robust video gaming fandom with over 300 million units sold worldwide; the Pokémon Trading Card Game available in 11 languages with more than 23.6 billion cards shipped; an animated television series in its 21st season that is available in more than 160 countries; and over 20 animated films; as well as books, manga comics, music, toys, merchandise, and apps, including the wildly popular Pokémon GO, that has been downloaded over 850 million times and is enjoyed across the globe by fans of all ages.“POKÉMON Detective Pikachu” is set for release on Friday, May 10, 2019.The film will be distributed outside of Japan and China by Warner Bros. Pictures, in Japan by Toho Company, Ltd. and by Legendary East in China."

She used spy gadgets and a hidden camera tracker device to sneak into the top secret laboratory. While inside they found mysterious clues about code 10 and the GM Network on his laptop. Rebecca Zamolo went home and reacted to the Game Master’s new video taking down Project Zorgo and tried to solve the mystery if they are working together. In today’s video Rebecca uses a treasure map inside the tunnel that leads her to an abandoned swimming pool where she finds a key hidden in the water. Matt and Rebecca hide behind a rock to spy on a secret meeting between the GameMaster and Pumpkin Patch along with two other mystery men ninjas. Using spy gadgets we heard mysterious code words then watched them each receive a final mystery note. Matt began secretly chasing Pumpkin Patch while I followed the Game Master into a new hidden cave.

Starring an eight year old star giving the performance of her life, all for her mum. Directed by Michael Gracey, the director of The Greatest Showman. The Show tells the story of the North Star overcoming her nerves to deliver a performance of a lifetime, to the amazement of mum. She is supported by a huge cast of 59 kids aged 6-11, all dressed as a variety of Christmas staples - including a turkey drummer and set of Christmas lights (plug included). The cast all dance and sing along as the stage transforms to reveal a 40ft Christmas tree and a 14ft glitter-filled gravy boat.The children’s real parents were featured in the crowd too, and were intentionally kept away from the castings and rehearsals until shoot day.We hope you enjoy seeing our whole cast give all they’ve got for the ones they love.Celebrate Christmas with Sainsbury's!Meet the kids behind the ad: https://youtu.be/F0XGgKStoVw 🎵: The North Star and Friends x Sainsbury’s - You Get What You GiveListen on Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/album/47EzNPreC2Dciijv8VglnzOriginal song by New Radicals.Shop online: https://www.sainsburys.co.uk/shop/gb/groceries/Christmas"

Me voy pa’ el caraYeay...ya Dice Como explicarle a la conciencia que esto fue mi culpa Como decirle al corazón que tú no volverás Hacer saber a mis ojos que no te verán nunca Como explicarle a mi boca que no la besaras Y no es que muera porque no tenga tus besos Pero es que vivir sin eso es como vivir sin razón Y si tú supieras como me duele el proceso De olvidarme de tu cuerpo me destroza el corazón Créeme un poco más, te lo suplico Que te me fuiste y no merezco este castigo Soy un loco más que no ha entendido Si yo solo te daba amor porque te has ido (porque te has ido)Es que se siente un frío terrible (frio terrible) Ya no se ni como decirte (como decirte) Contigo me sentía invencible Me llamas, pero de que me sirve Si aquí no estás en el mejor momento te vas Solo pido una oportunidad para demostrarte Que lo nuestro es amor de verdad Pero ya tú no estás en el mejor momento te vas Solo pido una oportunidad para demostrarte Que lo nuestro es amor de verdadCréeme un poco más, te lo suplico Que te me fuiste y no merezco este castigo Soy un loco más que no ha entendidoSi yo solo te daba amor porque te has ido Um yo yo yo no puedo olvidarte y no lo niego A pesar del tiempo que paso sin entendernos Yo si sabía que por la motonia de mi te irías, ay que ironía Es que ya tú no estás en el mejor momento te vas Solo pido una oportunidad para demostrarte Que lo nuestro es amor de verdad Pero no estás en el mejor momento te vas Solo pido una oportunidad para demostrarte Que lo nuestro es amor de verdadCréeme un poco más, te lo suplico Que te me fuiste y no merezco este castigo yeay Soy un loco mas que no ha entendido (que no ha entendido) Si yo solo te daba amor porque te has ido Créeme un poco más, te lo suplico Que te me fuiste y no merezco este castigo yeay Soy un loco más que no ha entendido Si yo solo te daba amor porque te has ido#Karol G #Créeme #Maluma #Culpables #AnuelAA #BebesitaMusic video by Karol G, Maluma performing Créeme. © 2018 UMG Recordings, Inc.http://vevo.ly/F54jH7"
