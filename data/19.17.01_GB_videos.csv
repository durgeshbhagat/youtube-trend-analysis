We can explore in detail the flagship A90 Edition version of the 5th generation Supra, but not only that I can also announce that I have ordered one too! Mine is also the very first one to be allocated in the UK, and will arrive later in 2019, more to come soon.The long-awaited A90 Supra has been a decade in the making and as it has arrived ever-closer there has been tremendous buzz around it with various concepts, racing versions and even the camoflagued car running at different events. However now released upon the world at the Detroit Motorshow, NAIAS, it has arrived in full for us to take in.The new car is based on a platform share with BMW and sits as the Coupe to its sister in the form of the soft-top BMW Z4. It's powered by the 3.0l inline-6 with 340PS and 500nm, which thanks to an 8spd auto means 0-100km/h (62mph) in 4.3 seconds. It's a 2-seat format with a large rear hatch and is positioned very much as a sporty driving experience with rear-wheel-drive.The 900 Club represents the first round of cars for Toyota with 900 allocations primarily to the UK and Germany as well as other European countries. Within those, there will be an opportunity for 90 customers to purchase the A90 Edition; which comes in the matte Storm Grey paintwork along with other distinct characteristics.With regards to my decision to place a deposit for a Supra; I've found it a fascinating story as the car has gone from the FT-1 Concept through to reveal now. I've been looking for a new 'daily driver' and it fits the bill as well as being a very interesting product in its own right to get to know and experience. I followed the process behind the scenes and ensured I was in the correct place during the day sales started so that the moment it went live I could lock in my deposit in which has turned out to be the first one for the UK market! Further information will come in due course which will establish if that certainly makes it possible to choose the A90 Edition specification, but I will update you when I know more.Thanks for watching, TimSubscribe: http://bit.ly/Shmee150YTWebsite: http://www.shmee150.comFacebook: http://www.fb.com/shmee150Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/shmee150"

Simen Eriksrud and musical partner Espen Berg formed Seeb through their love of defying genre and chasing the most fresh and original sounds. They scored a Hype Machine No.1 with their remix of Kiesza‚Äôs ‚ÄòCut Me Loose‚Äô, before extending their unique technique of vocal chopping on their globe-conquering take on Mike Posner‚Äôs ‚ÄòI Took A Pill In Ibiza‚Äô. It hit No. 2 on the Global Spotify Chart, No. 4 on Billboard Hot 100, became a world radio and dancefloor smash, soon becoming the second most played song globally in 2016. Before long, they gave their spin on Shawn Mendes‚Äô ‚ÄòStitches‚Äô, Chris Martin invited them to remix Coldplay‚Äôs ‚ÄòHymn For The Weekend‚Äô, they gave a new sense of colour to Taylor Swift‚Äôs ‚ÄòDelicate‚Äô, OneRepublic asked them to collaborate on ‚ÄòRich Love‚Äô and their adventurous and runaway original tracks with the likes of Skylar Grey and Dagny had them amassing over 4billion streams in just two years. Now, they‚Äôve teamed up with Bastille on their epic new single ‚ÄòGrip‚Äô ‚Äì a track that carries their signature blend of melancholy and euphoria, of dance music with a human sensibility.Video Director: Mina Solstad Nergaard Video Producer: H√•vard Bergo Video Editor: Mats Johannesen and H√•vard Bergo #itgripsmeLYRICSAs the night time bleeds into the day Tomorrow spills across the sky And the sun‚Äôs a harsh reminder why We are feeling barely human We don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs good for us Cos if we did we might not do it Who knows where our limits lie We won‚Äôt discover til we push it I should just walk away walk away But it grips me it grips me But I should call it a day and make my way oh it grips me Cos the devil‚Äôs got my arms and it pulls me back into the night/noise But I should just walk away away oh it grips me Cos the devil‚Äôs got my arms Cos the devil‚Äôs got my arms And it pulls me back into the night/noise We got drunk on this unholy wine To deliver us from our own minds The promise of a better time Till we‚Äôre feeling barely human I would rather forget and wash my memory clean x4"

Comment, like, share this story.Hannah and her family were on vacation in the countryside. They'd rented a little cottage on a farm. They loved all the farm animals, and the dogs and cats, and the great outdoors - fresh air. They had no idea they were about to come face-to-face with the worst kind of animal abuse and mistreatment. Real animal cruelty.On their last day they decided to take a hike around the farm and the woods around them. After walking for a little while they stumbled upon a huge, beautiful open field. Here mom, the nature lover, insisted that they walk through it.As they started hiking through the huge field they started seeing all these seemingly abandoned cars everywhere - minivans - parked randomly all over the field, and each one with dark windows and locked up with a padlock.When they walked up to one to peer inside the windows, what they saw was very, very disturbing. Each van was filled with animals, in cages, and it seemed that they had been really badly abused, neglected, and mistreated.They went from one rusted out old van to another, and inside each one were more abused animals - kittens and cats, puppies and dogs, birds and other small pets and animals. It got more and more suspicious and strange the further into the field they went. There must have been hundreds of abused animals, all in serious need of rescue.As they approached the other end of the field they came to a small fenced off area, a broken down paddock. In the middle of this tiny space was a horse, in just horrible condition. It was so underfed and uncared for - malnourished - that its ribs were sticking out and it was so thin you could count them. The poor horse was tied up to a stake, and the bridle had been rubbing against his nose and face - hurting him.It was absolutely horrifying. At that point her mom and dad had seen enough - they were really upset and concerned. How could no one have done anything about these poor neglected pets and animals, innocent dogs and cats and birds and horses? It was time to get out of there and do something to rescue these abused animals. Maybe they would call the police. Maybe Animal Rescue or a shelter, the ASPCA or RSPCA, but no matter what, it was illegal, a crime.When they got back to their cottage they went straight to the owner. She told them that the man who owns that other land had been in trouble, even arrested for abusing and neglecting animals before, and that he had been watching them the whole time they were on their hike.They immediately called the police and animal rescue and they came right away and took the horse and other animals. When Hannah saw some of the cats and dogs coming out of their cages, it broke her heart - some of them couldn't even walk. There were so many of them, so sick and neglected.It was sad, but Hannah was so happy that they had taken that walk and found those abused animals and made sure that they were rescued. And she wants everyone to know how awful it is to see these poor animals up close, and that if you do abuse animals and get caught, you will go to jail. And, if you see animals that appear to be neglected or abused, tell someone or call the police and make sure they get rescued! You might really be saving them._____What's your story?  storybooth wants to hear it!LINKS:Website: http://www.storybooth.comInstagram: @thestorybooth twitter @thestorybooth https://www.instagram.com/thestoryboothG+: https://plus.google.com/+StoryboothFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/thestorybooth/Tumblr: https://storybooth.tumblr.com/If you liked this storybooth animation and love storytime / story time story booth kid videos, watch our themed playlist collections:Being Yourself: https://goo.gl/89enENLove and Heartbreak: https://goo.gl/mfaoKwEmbarrassing and Funny: https://goo.gl/5GjxrWBullies and Mean People:https://goo.gl/THS3LBOvercoming Challenges: https://goo.gl/pbxRa9#storybooth #storyboothOnlyTrueStories"

Do they still own more than anybody else? Are they secretly the richest people in the world? The name Rothschild has become synonymous with wealth, and the story of this money-making family started with a man called Mayer Amschel Rothschild. His beginnings were what you might call humble, since he lived in a Jewish ghetto in Frankfurt, Germany, sharing a house with another 30 people. Both his parents died from smallpox when he was just 12 years old, and prior to that it was their wish that he become a rabbi. That didn‚Äôt happen, and instead at age just 13 the young Rothschild started an apprenticeship at a bank in Hanover. Through his early years he practiced commodities and money-trading as well as sold rare coins. Through that he rubbed shoulders with German nobility, and while he was working, he was also making children, ten in all.Let‚Äôs now see what happened next, in this episode of the Infographics Show, How much money do the Rothschilds have?So, we know it all started with Mayer Amschel Rothschild. In fact, this man is sometimes called ‚ÄúThe founding father of international finance.‚Äù We know he had ten kids, and five of those were sons. Each of these sons was responsible for running a finance house in Europe‚Äôs centers of finance. This family, or empire, worked under the motto: Unity, Integrity, Industry. We are told that understanding all the ways this family earned its fortune is not exactly clear, with one journalist saying, ‚ÄúThere is no book about them that is both revealing and accurate. Libraries of nonsense have been written about them.‚ÄùSUBSCRIBE TO US -‚ñ∫ http://bit.ly/TheInfographicsShow--------------------------------------------------------------------------WEBSITE (SUGGEST A TOPIC):http://theinfographicsshow.com SOCIAL:Twitter........‚ñ∫ https://twitter.com/TheInfoShowSubreddit...‚ñ∫ http://reddit.com/r/TheInfographicsShow--------------------------------------------------------------------------Sources for this episode:https://pastebin.com/YhFxwEmx"

And now, it's Carlton from the Fresh Prince of Bel Air! That's right, Carlton, Backpack Kid, and others are suing Fortnite for stealing their iconic dance moves. Can they legally do that?

We all like shopping, right? You know ‚Äì those moments when you feel down and say to yourself: ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt I just go to the mall and buy everything I want?‚Äù And then you come home with numerous bags containing things you actually don‚Äôt need, but you have a strange feeling of relief? Well, Denise can tell you that sometimes this seemingly innocent habit can become obsessive, and even dangerous.She was in high school when her life suddenly turned into hell. Everything was going perfect ‚Äì a loving family, nice friends, a wonderful boyfriend. When everything is going fine, at some point you start suspecting that it can‚Äôt last forever. And indeed, during her sophomore year, things started crumbling. Her parents had a huge argument and didn‚Äôt talk to each other. She even heard some conversations about a divorce. Denise became nervous because of these family problems, and couldn‚Äôt concentrate on her studies. Her grades went down.Unfortunately, for the first time in her life, Denise had a nervous breakdown, and had no idea how to handle it. The worst thing was that she had no one to confide in ‚Äì her parents had their own problems to deal with, and she had neither a best friend nor a boyfriend anymore. She didn‚Äôt want to bother people who weren‚Äôt very close to her, and she didn‚Äôt want to get too personal with them either. She had only one choice left to her ‚Äì to deal with her problems on her own. Denise found her very own way to decrease her stress levels, which was‚Ä¶shopping!She remembers once how her parents had a particularly heated argument, and she escaped from the house just to be on her own in silence for a while. ‚ÄúWhere can I go?‚Äù she thought. Of course, the mall! Lots of people, crowded shops, food court. A perfect place to hide from your thoughts. It would also be nice to buy herself a couple of new outfits as a distraction from her depressed mood. So that‚Äôs what she did, and she really did forget about her problems completely while she was trying on new jeans and choosing herself a new handbag.She had some money saved, and she had the opportunity to go shopping at least once a week. She was quickly becoming an addict ‚Äì at some point she began to want to buy more things, more often. She was doing it not because she needed anything, but because she wanted those positive emotions she felt when shopping. After a couple of months, Denise realized that she was quickly running out of money, as well as space in her room to keep all the things she was buying. But it didn‚Äôt bother her at all! So, she could dedicate herself to her ‚Äúhobby‚Äù completely.Actually, storage space objectively wasn‚Äôt a big problem ‚Äì she didn‚Äôt even wear what she bought, so she just stored new things wherever she could. Money was a bigger problem ‚Äì she spent all the money she had, and the weekly allowance from her parents wasn‚Äôt enough. She came up with an ingenious solution ‚Äì she started taking cash straight from her mom‚Äôs bag. She certainly wasn‚Äôt proud of herself, but she convinced herself that it was not stealing and that her mom wouldn‚Äôt mind anyway. Of course, it was stealing and now she feels ashamed about it! But at that moment she couldn‚Äôt help it ‚Äì she so needed money for her addiction.But then one day she decided that she needed to GO BIG. She took her dad‚Äôs credit card. What was she thinking?! Her idea was that if she spent just a little bit he wouldn‚Äôt notice. But unfortunately she didn‚Äôt manage to moderate her desires. She spent a huge sum of money, around 500 bucks, and returned the card to his wallet all scared and trembling about what he would do to her when he found out. But a day passed, then three, then five, and he seemed to have not noticed a thing. And she was dying to make another raid around the shops, so she thought, why don‚Äôt I do it just one more time?That time she just couldn‚Äôt stop, she spent and spent and spent without even trying anything on, just buying whatever she could see. Until at some point she heard that phrase that everyone dreads: ‚ÄúSorry, your card was declined‚Äù. Obviously, that was the signal to stop shopping. Of course, she became worried, because why on earth would a credit card be blocked? She got her answer at home when she was greeted by her dad, who was absolutely furious. He had been called by the bank and told that there had been numerous suspicious purchases on his card, and then he noticed that his credit card was missing. Denise decided not to invent any stories, and just told him the truth.Well, at that point her mom and dad finally united to punish her, and it was the turning point when they finally made peace. She got the attention she longed for, and after that particular shock, she didn‚Äôt even feel the urge to go shopping anymore. Now she‚Äôs obsessed with keeping fit. Well...At least it doesn‚Äôt cost money!Music by Epidemic Sound: https://www.epidemicsound.com"

Haunted by an unexplainable and unresolved trauma from her past and compounded by a string of eerie coincidences, Adelaide feels her paranoia elevate to high-alert as she grows increasingly certain that something bad is going to befall her family.After spending a tense beach day with their friends, the Tylers (Emmy winner Elisabeth Moss, Tim Heidecker, Cali Sheldon, Noelle Sheldon), Adelaide and her family return to their vacation home. When darkness falls, the Wilsons discover the silhouette of four figures holding hands as they stand in the driveway. Us pits an endearing American family against a terrifying and uncanny opponent: doppelg√§ngers of themselves. Writer and director Peele produces for his Monkeypaw Productions alongside Sean McKittrick, Jason Blum, and Monkeypaw‚Äôs Ian Cooper. Us will be released by Universal Pictures on Friday, March 22, 2019."

I thank every single one of you for watching my videos and supporting my channel. I will do my best to excel your expectations for years to come and provide entertainment you deserve. I thank you for everything, and I hope to one day make episode 2 a reality. In the mean time, all I ask, is for you to share this video, and hit like to spread to word. I couldn't have done this without the talented people behind it. You know who you are (that long credits list). I love you all. And to the fans, meeting hundreds of you at the free premiere in LA was surreal. I will post everything soon from the event. You've changed my life forever, and I hope to bring you this first episode (and many more I hope!) as a gratitude and gift for what you deserve. I am eternally grateful.ENJOY AND MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU, ALWAYS!!!!See Dislaimer below for more legal information.Starwarstheory66@gmail.com - StarWarsTheoryVaderfanfilm@gmail.com - Director Danny RamirezNO UPLOADING OF THIS VIDEO TO YOUTUBE, INSTAGRAM, FACEBOOK, OR ANY SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM.

Please see my comments below with regards to reports the video was partially faked.  Go to https://NordVPN.com/MarkRober and use code MARKROBER to get 75% off a 3 year plan and an extra month for free.My buddy Sean posted a video with more details of the build: https://youtu.be/IpMxOmUcfOINote about 2 missing the reactions in the video (I posted this on all my social channels immediately after it happened)- I was presented with information that caused me to doubt the veracity of 2 of the 5 reactions in the video.  These were reactions that were captured during a two week period while the device was at house 2 hours away from where I live.  I put a feeler out for people willing to put a package on their porch and this person (who is a friend of a friend) volunteered to help.  To compensate them for their time and willingness to risk putting a package on their porch I offered financial compensation for any successful recoveries of the package.  It appears (and I've since confirmed) in these two cases, the ‚Äúthieves were actually acquaintances of the person helping me.  From the footage I received from the phones which intentionally only record at specific times, this wasn‚Äôt clear to me. I have since removed those reactions from the original video (originally 6:26-7:59).  I‚Äôm really sorry about this.  Ultimately, I am responsible for the content that goes on my channel and I should have done more here.  I can vouch for that the reactions were genuine when the package was taken from my house.  Having said that, I know my credibility is damaged but I encourage you to look at the types of videos I‚Äôve been making for the past 7 years.  This is my first ever video with some kind of ‚Äúprank and like I mentioned in the video, it‚Äôs pretty removed from my comfort zone and I should have done more.  I‚Äôm especially gutted because so much thought, time, money and effort went into building the device and I hope this doesn‚Äôt just taint the entire effort as ‚Äúfake.  It genuinely works (like all the other things I‚Äôve built on my channel) and we‚Äôve made all the code and build info public.  Again, I‚Äôm sorry for putting something up on my channel that was misleading.  That is totally on me and I will take all necessary steps to make sure it won‚Äôt happen again.High Speed camera courtesy of https://www.aimed-research.com/.

Mr Corbyn pulled a screeching U-turn to move his motion two hours after appearing to abandon it while claiming the threat alone¬†had been enough to make the PM name a new date for the 'meaningful vote' on her Brexit deal. The bizarre sequence of events began at around 3pm when Mr Corbyn's said he would call for a vote if Mrs May did not reschedule the Brexit showdown she postponed last week. Mr Corbyn did not issue his motion when he spoke at 3.45pm - and Labour launched a social media blitz claiming the threat alone had been enough to get a date. Downing Street said it had made no difference and pointed out Mrs May said last week the vote would be held in the New Year and before January 21. Despite claiming victory, Mr Corbyn returned to the Commons at 5.50pm to table his motion anyway.Original Article: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6504533/Corbyn-set-demand-stunt-vote-no-confidence-Theresa-May.htmlOriginal Video: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/video/news/video-1826182/Video-WALKS-House-Commons-Corbyn-calls-vote-no-confidence.htmlDaily Mail Facebook: http://facebook.com/dailymailDaily Mail IG: http://instagram.com/dailymailDaily Mail Snap: https://www.snapchat.com/discover/Daily-Mail/8392137033Daily Mail Twitter: http://twitter.com/MailOnlineDaily Mail Pinterest: http://pinterest.co.uk/dailymailDaily Mail Google+: https://plus.google.com/+DailyMailGet the free Daily Mail mobile app: http://dailymail.co.uk/mobile"

What software do you use?A. Simon's Cat has been made using a variety of animation software over the years. Originally in Adobe Flash. Then TV Paint (and still on occasions) and most recently using CelAction.Q. Why does it take so long to make each Simon's Cat film?A. Animation is a slow process and Simon‚Äôs Cat films pay particular attention to observed, real life cat behaviour. Historically the films were traditionally animated frame by frame. More recently we use CelAction which has sped up the process but still requires a lot of care and attention. Each film takes approximately 6-9 weeks to make, depending on complexity, number of characters and special effects.#HappyHolidays #SnowballFight"
