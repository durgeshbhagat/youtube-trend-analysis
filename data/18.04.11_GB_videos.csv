Sometimes, a family is not what it seems to be. We all have our secrets, and when they're revealed, it can change us completely - and not necessarily in a bad way.  But let‚Äôs start from the beginning:Andrew's life was never anything special ‚Äì his mom and dad were simple people with regular jobs. They never had any big fights, but it wouldn't be true to say that he was close to them either. They didn‚Äôt talk much except about ordinary stuff like school, grades and what was for dinner.By the time Andrew's 15th birthday approached, his parents wanted to have a party with all their family friends and their children. Andrew was very annoyed, because he wanted to have fun with his friends. But his parents insisted, so he HAD to accept. During the party, one of the guests, who was a friend of his parents, said: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs amazing how much you look like your parents despite your situation.‚Äù Andrew was confused, and he immediately asked: ‚ÄúWhat situation?‚Äù ‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶‚Äù the guest said, ‚Äú...you don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶The rest of the party proceeded normally, but for days afterwards Andrew couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about what he had meant. One of the things that sprang into his mind was that maybe he had been adopted. It could have been true, because he‚Äôd always noticed small differences between his parents and himself. So one day at dinner, Andrew asked the question straight out. His parents just stared at him with a worried look on their faces, not saying anything. And at this moment he realized that he'd found out the truth. And it made him ANGRY. It turned out that EVERYONE knew except him. And it hurt, a lot. Andrew kept asking himself: Who I am? What do I do now? It was a very confusing and scary time for him.He almost started a rebellion. He spent a lot of time outside late at night, and his grades at school went down. The thing he just couldn‚Äôt understand was why they refused to talk to him about it. Why did they try to act as though everything was normal? And what was even worse was that they got angry at him when he stayed out for too long, and tried to control him. They weren‚Äôt even his real parents, so what right they had to do that?One evening, when he got back late, his father started shouting at Andrew for being spoiled and ungrateful despite everything they did for him. So he turned straight around and left the house. He didn‚Äôt know where to go, so he just walked through the dark streets. He doesn‚Äôt know how long he walked for, but it felt like hours. Andrew couldn't stop thinking about how nobody really cared about him. His real parents had probably left him, and it seemed that he was nothing more than a nuisance to his adopted ones. He couldn‚Äôt go back home, so he went to his favorite childhood place ‚Äì a pond where he had loved to look at the ducks when he was little. Andrew sat there, cold and sad, and cried. He was completely lost.Suddenly, he saw his parents' car drive up next to the pond. His mother got out of the car. She looked scared and worried. She came up to Andrew and hugged him.  ‚ÄúWe were so worried! We didn‚Äôt know how to find you, so your father said that we should try looking for you at the pond‚Äù. Andrew still couldn't stop crying, and he started asking his mother questions ‚Äì why did his real parents leave him? Why had they never told him?His mother sighed, then finally started answering his questions: ‚ÄúTo be honest, darling, your real parents just didn‚Äôt want you. But we do want you. And we love you. Both me and your father. We decided not to tell you, so you would have a normal childhood. But I guess we were wrong. I‚Äôm sorry. You are the best thing that ever happened to us.‚ÄùThe only thing Andrew couldn‚Äôt understand was why his father was still just sitting in the car and hadn't even come out to talk to him. He looked through the window...and noticed that he was crying as well. Andrew had never seen his father cry. In fact, he rarely saw him showing any emotion. And his tears revealed more than his words could ever say. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go home,‚Äù his mom said. And he did.Andrew realized that his parents weren't perfect ‚Äì  they didn‚Äôt always know how to express their emotions or how to do the right thing. But they did love him. And it didn‚Äôt matter if he was adopted or not. They're still his parents, and he loves them despite all their peculiarities. Being loved is one of the best feelings in the world. And he was loved. And for that moment, that was enough for him to be happy again.Music by Epidemic Sound: https://www.epidemicsound.com"

It has allowed me to make something beautiful for my son -- in his honor.  Early in the process, many of us agreed that Runaway would be a great song to release as a single for COWYS 2.  It is a powerful song that tells the story of how Gus--aka Lil Peep--had decided to leave his apartment in LA, but he didn't want to come home to live in Long Beach, either.  So, he had gone to stay in London.  That was a productive and happy time for him--working with friends like Smokeasac and ILoveMakonnen.This video tells that part of Gus's story.  The story is told using many of Gus's drawings, from different periods of his life.  After transforming into the wonderful flaming-haired character that Gus drew, himself, he flies away from LAX to London--to make music with some of his best friends.I know you will enjoy watching it.  You will see different things each time you watch.  His drawings.  His tattoos.  His friends.  The house where he really lived.  And his dog, Taz, the legend./////Directed by Liza Womack & Steven Mertens (@stevenstmertens)Special Thanks to Smokeasac and ILoveMakonnenAdditional Footage provided by Richard Stilwell/////http://www.lilpeep.party/http://twitter.com/lilpeephttp://instagram.com/lilpeephttp://soundcloud.com/lil_peephttp://facebook.com/lilpeepmusic"

Freddie defied stereotypes and shattered convention to become one of the most beloved entertainers on the planet. The film traces the meteoric rise of the band through their iconic songs and revolutionary sound. They reach unparalleled success, but in an unexpected turn Freddie, surrounded by darker influences, shuns Queen in pursuit of his solo career. Having suffered greatly without the collaboration of Queen, Freddie manages to reunite with his bandmates just in time for Live Aid. While bravely facing a recent AIDS diagnosis, Freddie leads the band in one of the greatest performances in the history of rock music. Queen cements a legacy that continues to inspire outsiders, dreamers and music lovers to this day.Now PlayingCast: Rami Malek, Lucy Boynton, Gwilym Lee, Ben Hardy, Joseph Mazzello, Aidan Gillen, Tom Hollander, Allen Leech and Mike MyersDirected by: Bryan SingerConnect with Bohemian Rhapsody Online:Visit the Bohemian Rhapsody WEBSITE: http://bohemianrhapsody.comLike Bohemian Rhapsody on FACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/BohemianRhapsodyMovieFollow Bohemian Rhapsody on TWITTER: https://twitter.com/BoRhapMovieFollow Bohemian Rhapsody on INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/BohemianRhapsodyMovie#BohemianRhapsodyAbout 20th Century FOX:Official YouTube Channel for 20th Century Fox Movies.
